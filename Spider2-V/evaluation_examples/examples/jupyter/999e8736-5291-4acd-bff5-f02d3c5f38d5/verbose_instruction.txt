This task requires you to build a SVM model using scikit-learn and print the accuracy score. Follow the steps:
1. Add the following code below the ``#TODO 1`` comment.
```python
from sklearn import svm
```
2. Add the following code below the ``#TODO 2`` comment.
```python
clf = svm.SVC(kernel='linear')
```
3. Add the following code below the ``#TODO 3`` comment.
```python
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```
4. Add the following code below the ``#TODO 4`` comment.
```python
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
```
5. Add the following code below the ``#TODO 5`` comment.
```python
print(metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
```
