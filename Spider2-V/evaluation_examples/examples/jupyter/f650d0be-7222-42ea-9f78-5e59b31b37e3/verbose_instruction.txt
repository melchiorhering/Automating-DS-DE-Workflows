This task is to find baby names that appear in all recorded years and sort them in descending order by their total occurrences. On the opened jupyter notebook:
1. Double-click "result.csv" to see the predefined format
2. Double-click "usa_baby_names.csv" to preview the us baby data.
3. Double-click "notebook.ipynb" to see the partial finished code.
4. Scroll down to the bottom, hover your mouse over the blank space at the bottom.

6. Copy the code below to this cell:

  first_name VARCHAR(64),
  sex VARCHAR(64),
  num INT
);
""")
conn.commit()

```
7. Click button "Click to add a cell."
8. Copy the code below to this cell:

```
df = pd.read_csv('usa_baby_names.csv')
df.to_sql('baby_names', conn, if_exists='append', index=False)
conn.commit()
query = """
SELECT first_name, SUM(num) as total_num
FROM baby_names
GROUP BY first_name
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT year) >= 101
ORDER BY total_num DESC;
"""
result = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)
result.to_csv('result.csv', index=False)
conn.close()

```
9. Click the button "Run" in the menu bar on the top.
10. In the drop-down menu, select and click "Run All Cells".
11. Wait for about 10 seconds, the data will be inserted in to "result.csv"
