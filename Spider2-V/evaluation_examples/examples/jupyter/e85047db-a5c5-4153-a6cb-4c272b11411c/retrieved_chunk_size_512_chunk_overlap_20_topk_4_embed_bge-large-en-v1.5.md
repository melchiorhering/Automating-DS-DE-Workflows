JupyterLab will open automatically in the browser. See the documentationfor additional details.

If you encounter an error like "Command 'jupyter' not found", please make sure `PATH`environment variable is set correctly. Alternatively, you can start up JupyterLab using `~/.local/bin/jupyter lab`without changing the `PATH`environment variable.

Prerequisites and Supported BrowsersThe latest versions of the following browsers are currently *known to work*:

* Firefox
* Chrome
* Safari

See our documentationfor additional details.

Getting helpWe encourage you to ask questions on the Discourse forum. A question answered there can become a useful resource for others.

Bug reportTo report a bug please read the guidelinesand then open a Github issue. To keep resolved issues self-contained, the lock botwill lock closed issues as resolved after a period of inactivity. If a related discussion is still needed after an issue is locked, please open a new issue and reference the old issue.

Feature requestWe also welcome suggestions for new features as they help make the project more useful for everyone. To request a feature please use the feature request template.

JupyterLab!!!!!!!!!!

!An extensible environment for interactive and reproducible computing, based on the
Jupyter Notebook and Architecture.

JupyterLabis the next-generation user interface for Project Jupyteroffering
all the familiar building blocks of the classic Jupyter Notebook (notebook,
terminal, text editor, file browser, rich outputs, etc.) in a flexible and
powerful user interface.

JupyterLab can be extended using npmpackages
that use our public APIs. The *prebuilt*extensions can be distributed
via PyPI,
conda, and other package managers. The *source*extensions can be installed
directly from npm (search for jupyterlab-extension) but require an additional build step.
You can also find JupyterLab extensions exploring GitHub topic jupyterlab-extension.
To learn more about extensions, see the user documentation.

Read the current JupyterLab documentation on ReadTheDocs.

Getting startedInstallationIf you use conda, mamba, or pip, you can install JupyterLab with one of the following commands.

* If you use conda:
```
conda install-cconda-forgejupyterlabCopy
```
* If you use mamba:
```
mamba install-cconda-forgejupyterlabCopy
```
* If you use pip:
```
pip installjupyterlabCopy
```
If installing using `pip install --user`, you must add the user-level `bin`directory to your `PATH`environment variable in order to launch `jupyter lab`. If you are using a Unix derivative (e.g., FreeBSD, GNU/Linux, macOS), you can do this by running `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"`. If you are using a macOS version that comes with Python 2, run `pip3`instead of `pip`.

For more detailed instructions, consult the installation guide. Project installation instructions from the git sources are available in the contributor documentation.

Installing with Previous Versions of Jupyter NotebookWhen using a version of Jupyter Notebook earlier than 5.3, the following command must be run after installing JupyterLab to enable the JupyterLab server extension:
