This task requires you to apply some data preprocessing techniques, especially data scaling, to the famous California Housing Datasets.
1. Add the following code below the ``#TODO 1`` comment.
```python
df.head()
```
2. Add the following code below the ``#TODO 2`` comment.
```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.25, random_state=SEED)
```
3. Add the following code below the ``#TODO 3`` comment. First, instantiate a standard scaler.
```python
scaler = StandardScaler()
```
4. Next, fit the scaler according to our training dataset.
```python
scaler.fit(X_train)
```
5. Finally, transform both training dataset and testing dataset.
```python
X_train = scaler.transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)
```
6. Click the button "Run" in the menu bar on the top.
7. In the drop-down menu, select and click "Run All Cells".
8. Wait until all cells completes running, then click the button "File" in the menu bar on the top.
9. In the drop-down menu, select and click "Save All".
