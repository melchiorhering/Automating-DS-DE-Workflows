1. Click the "Append sheet" on the left of "Sheet1" on the bottom (its icon is a sheet of paper with a "+" on the bottom-right). A new sheet with name "Sheet2" will be created.
2. In the new Sheet2, select cells A1:B1.
3. Right click and choose "Merge Cells" option.
4. Input "Summer sales ($)" in the merged cell.

10. Similarly, press and drag "Revenue" from the available fields to "Data Fields:" in the middle.
