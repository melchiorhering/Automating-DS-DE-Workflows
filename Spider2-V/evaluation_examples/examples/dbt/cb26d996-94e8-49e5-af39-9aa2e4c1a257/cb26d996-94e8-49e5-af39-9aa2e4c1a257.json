    "instruction": "I have noticed that the snapshot \"orders_snapshot\" depends on on an undeclared source. Help me add the source declaration and then re-run the entire project, so that \"dbt snapshot\" command could be executed successfully.\nHere is a step-by-step tutorial from an expert instructing you how to complete it:\nThis task requires you to declare sources for dbt snapshot reference.\n1. Open \"models/schema.yml\" in the VSCode editor.\n2. Append the following codes into the YML file.\n```yml\nsources:\n  - name: analytics\n    schema: analytics\n    tables:\n      - name: orders\n```\n3. Switch to the terminal.\n4. Run ``dbt seed`` to load the seeds.\n5. Run ``dbt run`` to execute the models.\nYou can exactly follow the detailed plan above or proactively tackle the task based on the real-time environment interaction by yourself.",
