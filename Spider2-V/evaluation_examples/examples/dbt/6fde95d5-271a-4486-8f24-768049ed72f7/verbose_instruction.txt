In this task, you need to complete the declaration of a model and then execute it.
1. Switch to the terminal.
2. Run ``dbt debug`` to connect to the database.
3. Run ``dbt seed`` to load the seeds ``raw_customers.csv`` and ``raw_orders.csv`` used in the model ``customers.sql``.
4. Switch to the VSCode editor.
5. Open the file "models/customers.sql" in the VSCode editor.
6. Notice the columns to be selected are missing. Copy and paste the following codes into the select block:
```sql
customers.customer_id,
customers.first_name,
customers.last_name,
customer_orders.first_order_date,
customer_orders.most_recent_order_date,
coalesce(customer_orders.number_of_orders, 0) as number_of_orders
```
7. Switch to the terminal again, and run ``dbt run`` to execute the model.
