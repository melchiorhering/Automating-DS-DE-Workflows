    "instruction": "Complete the declaration of the dbt model named \"customers\", then build it from scratch. The requirements are specified as comments in the sql file \"customers.sql\".\nHere is a step-by-step tutorial from an expert instructing you how to complete it:\nIn this task, you need to complete the declaration of a model and then execute it.\n1. Switch to the terminal.\n2. Run ``dbt debug`` to connect to the database.\n3. Run ``dbt seed`` to load the seeds ``raw_customers.csv`` and ``raw_orders.csv`` used in the model ``customers.sql``.\n4. Switch to the VSCode editor.\n5. Open the file \"models/customers.sql\" in the VSCode editor.\n6. Notice the columns to be selected are missing. Copy and paste the following codes into the select block:\n```sql\ncustomers.customer_id,\ncustomers.first_name,\ncustomers.last_name,\ncustomer_orders.first_order_date,\ncustomer_orders.most_recent_order_date,\ncoalesce(customer_orders.number_of_orders, 0) as number_of_orders\n```\n7. Switch to the terminal again, and run ``dbt run`` to execute the model.\nYou can exactly follow the detailed plan above or proactively tackle the task based on the real-time environment interaction by yourself.",
