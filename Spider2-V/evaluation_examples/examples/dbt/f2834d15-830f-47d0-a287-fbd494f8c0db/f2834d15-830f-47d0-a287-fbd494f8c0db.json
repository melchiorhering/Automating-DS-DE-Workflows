    "instruction": "Create a new deploy job named \"check_source\" on the environment of the same name. Suppose the snapshot freshness info has been configured, this job should constantly and independently capture the source freshness snapshots. Choose a proper timing interval given a lowest dataset SLA frequency of 2 hours.\nHere is a step-by-step tutorial from an expert instructing you how to complete it:\nThis task aims to create a job to constantly check source freshness.\n1. Click \"Deploy\" in the upper panel.\n2. Choose \"Jobs\".\n3. Click \"Create job\", and choose \"Deploy job\".\n4. Now you will see the configuration page of a new job. In \"Job settings\" section, set the \"Job name\" to \"check_source\".\n5. In \"Execution settings\" section, check \"Run source freshness\" tick box.\n6. In \"Triggers\" section, enable \"Run on schedule\".\n7. Click \"Timing\" selection list, and choose \"Interval\" as the timing scheme.\n8. Click \"Run every (UTC)\" section, and choose \"Every 1 hour\" in the drop-down panel.\n9. Click \"Save\" button on the top right of the page.\nYou can exactly follow the detailed plan above or proactively tackle the task based on the real-time environment interaction by yourself.",
