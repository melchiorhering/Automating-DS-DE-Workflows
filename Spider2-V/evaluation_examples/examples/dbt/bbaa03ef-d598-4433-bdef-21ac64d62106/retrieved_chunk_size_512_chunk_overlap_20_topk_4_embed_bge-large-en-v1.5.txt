Run
dbt test
, and confirm that all your tests passed.
When you run
dbt test
, dbt iterates through your YAML files, and constructs a query for each test. Each query will return the number of records that fail the test. If this number is 0, then the test is successful.
FAQs
​
What tests are available for me to use in dbt? Can I add my own custom tests?
Does my test file need to be named `schema.yml`?
Document your models
