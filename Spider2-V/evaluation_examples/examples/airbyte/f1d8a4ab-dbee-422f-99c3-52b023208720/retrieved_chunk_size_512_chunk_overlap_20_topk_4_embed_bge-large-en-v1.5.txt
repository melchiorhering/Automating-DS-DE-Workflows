Update: Modify a record in the source
Go back to the Postgres shell in the
airbyte-source
container that you opened earlier in this tutorial, and update a record in
table_one
and view the table as follows:
UPDATE table_one SET name='Eg2b IncAp' WHERE id=2;
SELECT * FROM table_one;
‍
And the source
table_one
table should now look as follows:
id |    name    |         updated_at         
----+------------+----------------------------
  1 | Eg1 IncApp | 2022-09-01 11:01:41.666004
  2 | Eg2b IncAp | 2022-09-01 11:16:38.093877
(2 rows)
‍
The
name
and the
updated_at
values have been updated as expected. Execute a new sync by clicking on
Sync Now
in the connections UI and wait for the sync to complete. You should see a response indicating that one record has been emitted, as follows:
‍
‍
ℹ️  Note that opposed to the full sync modes discussed in the
previous tutorial
which would emit all of the records in the source on each sync, in the incremental sync modes only new or modified records are emitted – this is handled in the source connector logic, which only selects new documents in the source for replication to the destination.
A single record has been emitted, which corresponds to the record that was just updated. Additionally, make a note of the
job ID
and the
attempt ID
which in this case are 150 and 0. You will use these values later to view the SQL that has been used for normalization.
Update: View the raw table in the destination
Look at the raw table called
_airbyte_raw_table_one
by executing the following command in the destination Postgres shell:
SELECT * FROM _airbyte_raw_table_one;
‍
Which should respond with a table that looks as follows:
_airbyte_ab_id            |                                _airbyte_data                                |    _airbyte_emitted_at

However, in this sync mode
the final data table is deduped and only contains a single copy of each record
corresponding to each
unique id
in the source system.

Update: Modify a record in the source
Go back to the Postgres shell in the
airbyte-source
container that you opened earlier in this tutorial, and update a record in
table_two
and view the table as follows:
UPDATE table_two SET name='Eg2b DD+Hs' WHERE id=2;
SELECT * FROM table_two;
‍
And the source
table_two
table should now look as follows:
id |    name    |         updated_at         
----+------------+----------------------------
  1 | Eg1 DD+Hst | 2022-09-01 16:18:07.569818
  2 | Eg2b DD+Hs | 2022-09-01 17:02:14.841419

Update: View the raw table in the destination
Look at the

raw table called

with the following command on the destination Postgres database.

I will discuss this in more detail after the next sync.
Insert a new record on the source
If you don’t have a terminal open on the Postgres source database, open one as follows:
docker exec -it airbyte-source /bin/bash
psql --username=postgres
‍
Add a new record to the source Postgres database as follows:
INSERT INTO full_refresh_demo(id, name) VALUES(3, 'Alex M');
‍
And view the source table by executing:
SELECT * FROM full_refresh_demo;
‍
The source table should look as follows:
id |  name  
----+--------
  1 | Mary X
  2 | John D
  3 | Alex M
(3 rows)
Execute a new sync by clicking on
Sync Now
in the connection pane and wait for the sync to complete.
‍
‍
Once complete, you should see that three records have been emitted. Also take note of the
job ID
and
attempt ID
, which are 104 and 0 for this run.

This new record will be appended to the raw table in the destination and will be then normalized and appended to the final data table as shown below:
Insert: Write a new record in the source
Go back to the Postgres shell in the
airbyte-source
container that you opened earlier in this tutorial, and insert a new record into
table_one
and view it as follows:
INSERT INTO table_one(id, name) VALUES(3, 'Eg3 IncApp');
SELECT * FROM table_one;;

The source
table_one
table should look as follows:
id |    name    |         updated_at

You should see that one record has been emitted, which corresponds to the record that you have just inserted into
table_one
.
