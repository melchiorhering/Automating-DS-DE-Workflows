Validate data replication pipelines from Postgres to Snowflake with data-diff | Airbyte

Documentation Content:
First, we are going to start by setting up our Postgres source and Snowflake destination within Airbyte.
Set up your Postgres source
On
Airbyte Cloud
or
Airbyte Open Source
, click “new connection”. This will bring you to a screen where you can select your data source. Choose “
Postgres
” as your source type.
Now you will be brought to a screen where you need to enter some specific information about your Postgres database. This includes host, port, database name, and a list of the schemas you wish to sync.
I kept the default port and added my database named `development`, `customers` schema, and the login information for my Airbyte user. It is best practice to
create users specific to the tools
you are connecting to your database.
Set up your Snowflake destination
Now let’s set up our
Snowflake destination
where we will be replicating our Postgres data to. Start by clicking on “new destination” in the top right corner. Then select “Snowflake” as your destination type.
‍
This is where you will input the information for the Snowflake database that you are copying your Postgres data. Make sure you enter the right location information!
I also recommend setting up a role that is specific for loading data in your destination as well. This will help keep your environment secure and all you to closely monitor different metrics on the replication process.
Set up a Postgres to Snowflake connection
Now that you’ve created both your source in Postgres and your destination in Snowflake, you can set up a connection between the two to replicate your data from Postgres. Select “connections” on the left panel.
Select your Postgres source you created from the dropdown, then select Snowflake as your destination.
Now you’ll want to give the connection a good name and choose how often it replicates. I’m going to call mine “postgres_snowflake_replication” and set it t replicate every 24 hours.
I also recommend selecting “mirror source structure” for the “destination namespace”. This will allow you to easily compare the differences between the source table and the destination table.

Here, you should see your source and destination connectors, as well as the connection between them, set up and ready to go.
Next Steps
Once you've set up and launched this initial integration, the real power lies in its adaptability and extensibility. Here’s a roadmap to help you customize and harness this project tailored to your specific data needs:
Extend the Project
:
The real beauty of this integration is its extensibility. Whether you want to add more data sources, integrate additional tools, or add some transformation logic – the floor is yours. With the foundation set, sky's the limit for how you want to extend and refine your data processes.
