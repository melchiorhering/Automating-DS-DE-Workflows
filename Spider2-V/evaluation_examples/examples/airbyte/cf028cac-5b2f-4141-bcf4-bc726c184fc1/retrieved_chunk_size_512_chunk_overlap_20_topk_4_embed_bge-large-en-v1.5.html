In this tutorial I will demonstrate CDC replication only with the incremental dedupe synchronization mode.</p><blockquote>ℹ️ The steps presented in this section could also be used for testing other sync modes.</blockquote><p>Define a new connection that will be used for incremental CDC replication as follows: </p><blockquote>ℹ️  In the definition of a CDC replication connection, notice that a <em>cursor field</em>is not required (as opposed to “standard” <a>incremental replication</a>). Furthermore, the <em>primary key</em>is automatically determined from the source table, and is therefore not selected. </blockquote><p>Once you click on <em>Set up connection</em>, Airbyte will start a sync operation from the source to the destination.

If everything goes well, you should see a successful message.</p></div><h2>Step 4: Configure a local JSON destination in Airbyte</h2><div><p>Go to destinations and add a new one. As demonstrated in the following diagram, select <em>Local JSON</em>as the destination type and fill in with the following details.</p><ul><li><strong>Name:</strong>JSON CDC Tutorial (or any name you would like)</li><li><strong>Destination_path:</strong>/cdc_tutorial (or any path where you'd like to store the Postgres data)</li></ul><p>‍</p><p>Then click on <em>Set up source</em>and let Airbyte test the destination.</p></div><h2>Step 5: Create an Airbyte connection</h2><div><p>Go to connections and create a new connection. Then, select the existing Postgres source you have just created and then do the same for the Local JSON destination. Once you're done, you can set up the connection as follows.</p><ul><li><strong>Replication Frequency:</strong>I recommend setting it to "manual" if you're testing. You can change to any frequency that makes sense to your use case when you're ready.</li><li><strong>Destination Namespace: </strong>Mirror source structure</li><li><strong>Destination Stream Prefix:</strong>You can leave this option blank, as we don't want a prefix at the destination.</li></ul><p>Then, it's time to configure the <a>streams</a>, which in this case are the tables in our database. For now, we only have the <em>cars</em>table. If you expand it, you can see the columns it has.</p><p>Now, you should select a <strong>sync mode</strong>. If you want to take full advantage of using Change Data Capture, you should use <em>Incremental | Append</em>mode to only look at the rows that have changed in the source and sync them to the destination.

Build an EL(T) from Postgres CDC (Change Data Capture) | Airbyte

Documentation Content:
Selecting a <em>Full Refresh</em>mode would sync the whole source table, which is most likely not what you want when using CDC. Learn more about sync modes in <a>our documentation</a>.</p><p>When using an <em>Incremental</em>sync mode, we would generally need to provide a <em>Cursor field</em>, but when using CDC, that's not necessary since the changes in the source are detected via the Debezium connector stream.</p><p>Once you're ready, save the changes. Then, you can run your first sync by clicking on <em>Sync now</em>. You can check your run logs to verify everything is going well. Just wait for the sync to be completed, and that's it! You've replicated data using Postgres Change Data Capture.</p></div><h2>Step 6: Verify that the sync worked</h2><div><p>From the root directory of the Airbyte project, go to <em>/tmp/airbyte_local/cdc_tutorial</em>, and you will find a file named <em>_airbyte_raw_cars.jsonl</em>where the data from the PostgreSQL database was replicated.</p><p>You can check the file's contents in your preferred IDE or run the following command.</p><code>cat _airbyte_raw_cars.jsonl
</code><p>‍</p></div><h2>Step 7: Test CDC in action by creating and deleting an object from the database</h2><div><p>Now, let's test the CDC setup we have configured. To do that, run the following queries to insert and delete a row from the database.</p><code>INSERT INTO cars VALUES(3, 'tesla');
DELETE FROM cars WHERE NAME = 'tesla';
</code><p>Launch a sync and, once it finishes, check the local JSON file to verify that CDC has captured the change. The JSON file should now have two new lines, showing the addition and deletion of the row from the database.
