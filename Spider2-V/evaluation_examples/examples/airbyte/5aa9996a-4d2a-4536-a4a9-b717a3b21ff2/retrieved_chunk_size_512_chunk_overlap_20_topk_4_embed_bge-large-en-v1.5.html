that you've learned how to set up your first <a>source</a>and <a>destination</a>, it's time to finish the setup by creating your very first connection!</p><p>On the left side of your main Airbyte dashboard, select <strong>Connections</strong>. You will be prompted to choose which source and destination to use for this connection. For this example, we'll use the <strong>Google Sheets</strong>source and the destination you previously set up, either <strong>Local JSON</strong>or <strong>Google Sheets</strong>.</p><h2>Configure the connection<a>​</a></h2><p>Once you've chosen your source and destination you can configure the connection. You'll first be asked a few questions about how your data should sync, these correlate to our sync modes which you can read more about on <a>this page</a>.</p><p>Most users select "Mirror Source", which will simply copy the data from the source to the destination where you'll see one row in the destination for each row in the source. If you prefer to Append Historical Changes or take a Full Snapshot with each sync, you can optionally select those options, but keep in mind those will create duplicate records in your destination. The sync mode we choose for all the enabled streams will reflect your selection here.</p><p>Next, you can toggle which streams you want to replicate. Our test data consists of three streams, which we've enabled and set to <code>Incremental - Append + Deduped</code>sync mode.</p><p>Your sync mode is already determined by your selection above, but you can change the sync mode for an individual stream. You can also select a cursor or primary key to enable incremental and/or deduplication. For more information on the nature of each sync mode supported by Airbyte, see <a>this page</a>.</p><p>You can also select individual fields to sync on this page. Expand the fields available by clicking any stream. This is helpful when you have security concerns or don't want to sync all the data from the source.
</p><p>Click <strong>Next</strong>to complete your stream setup and move to the connection configuration.

you will now see three tabs created in your Google Sheet, <code>products</code>, <code>users</code>, and <code>purchases</code>.</p><div><p>If you followed along and created your own connection using a <code>Local JSON</code>destination, you can use this command to check the file's contents to make sure the replication worked as intended (be sure to replace YOUR_PATH with the path you chose in your destination setup, and YOUR_STREAM_NAME with the name of an actual stream you replicated):</p><span>cat /tmp/airbyte_local/YOUR_PATH/_airbyte_raw_YOUR_STREAM_NAME.jsonl</span><p>You should see a list of JSON objects, each containing a unique <code>airbyte_ab_id</code>, an <code>emitted_at</code>timestamp, and <code>airbyte_data</code>containing the extracted record.</p><div><div>tip</div><p>If you are using Airbyte on Windows with WSL2 and Docker, refer to <a>this guide</a>to locate the replicated folder and file.</p></div></div></div></div><h2>What's next?<a>​</a></h2><p>Congratulations on successfully setting up your first connection using Airbyte! We hope that this will be just the first step on your journey with us. We support a large, ever-growing <a>catalog of sources and destinations</a>, and you can even <a>contribute your own</a>.</p><p>If you have any questions at all, please reach out to us on <a>Slack</a>. If you would like to see a missing feature or connector added, please create an issue on our <a>Github</a>.
