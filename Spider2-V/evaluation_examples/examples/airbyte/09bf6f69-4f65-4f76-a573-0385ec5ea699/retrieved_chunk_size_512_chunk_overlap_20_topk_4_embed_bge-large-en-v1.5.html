If you sync job completes in multiple attempts, you'll need to define which attempt you're interested in, and note this.

# Retrieve SQL table for data stream

</code><p>When accessing data through the &lt;span class="text-style-code"&gt;streams&lt;/span&gt; dataset, you are directly accessing data from the backend SQL data store. If you are retrieving data using a past &lt;span class="text-style-code"&gt;SyncResult&lt;/span&gt;, note that this method will also include the latest data and is not necessarily specific to a certain execution.</p><h2>Advanced Options</h2><h3>Submitting Jobs Asynchronously </h3><p>By default, PyAirbyte will wait for completion when you call &lt;span class="text-style-code"&gt;run_sync()&lt;/span&gt;. You can instead return immediately by setting &lt;span class="text-style-code"&gt;wait=False&lt;/span&gt;. Then you can check on the connection yourself by calling &lt;span class="text-style-code"&gt;get_status()&lt;/span&gt; or  &lt;span class="text-style-code"&gt;is_complete()&lt;/span&gt; on the &lt;span class="text-style-code"&gt;SyncResult&lt;/span&gt; object:</p><code>sync_result = workspace.run_sync(wait=False)

while not sync_result.is_complete():
# Do other things while we wait...
sleep(5)

print(f"Sync was completed. Status is {sync_result.get_status()}.")</code><h3>Opening up Hybrid Use Cases</h3><p>Now you can harness the Power of Airbyte running locally and remotely, here as some example use cases for the “hybrid” deployment options.</p><h4>PyAirbyte as a Mini-Orchestrator</h4><p>Now with the latest version of PyAirbyte, you can use PyAirbyte as a mini-orchestrator. For instance, you can run a sequence of jobs in a specific order, and you can trigger Airbyte jobs in response to custom business logic and custom features.
