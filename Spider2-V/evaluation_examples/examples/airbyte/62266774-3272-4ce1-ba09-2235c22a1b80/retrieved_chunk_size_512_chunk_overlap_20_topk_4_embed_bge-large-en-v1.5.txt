Documentation Title:
Orchestrate ELT pipelines with Prefect, Airbyte and dbt | Airbyte

Documentation Content:
In this recipe we‚Äôll create a Prefect flow to orchestrate Airbyte and dbt.
Airbyte
is a data integration tool that allows you to extract data from APIs and databases and load it to data warehouses, data lakes, and databases. In this recipe, we‚Äôll use Airbyte to replicate data from the GitHub API into a Snowflake warehouse.
dbt
is a data transformation tool that allows you to transform data within a data warehouse more effectively. We‚Äôll use dbt in this recipe to transform data from multiple sources into one table to find common contributors between our three repositories.
Prerequisites
In order to follow the steps in this recipe you‚Äôll need to make sure that you have the following installed on your local machine:
Docker and Docker Compose
Python 3.8+
Set up Snowflake
For this tutorial, you can set up a Snowflake account if you don‚Äôt already have one. Snowflake has a generous free tier, so no cost will be incurred while going through this recipe. Airbyte requires some resources to be created in Snowflake to enable data replication from GitHub. You can refer to the
Airbyte Snowflake destination documentation
for the steps necessary to configure Snowflake to allow Airbyte to load data in.

Set up Airbyte
For this recipe, we‚Äôll use Docker Compose to run an Airbyte installation locally. The commands necessary to run Airbyte can be found in the
Airbyte quickstart guide
.
Set up GitHub sources
Airbyte has a GitHub source that allows us to easily pull the information that we want via the GitHub API. We will set up a source for each of the three repositories that we want to pull data from so that we can have tables in Snowflake for each repository. This is the configuration that we‚Äôll be using for the Prefect repository:
‚Äç
Once that source is successfully configured, we‚Äôll set up two additional sources for the airbytehq/airbyte and dbt-labs/dbt-core repositories.

Documentation Title:
E-commerce Analytics Stack with Airbyte, dbt, Airflow (ADA) and BigQuery | Airbyte

Documentation Content:
This will initiate the complete data pipeline, starting with the Airbyte sync from Faker to BigQuery, followed by dbt transforming the raw data into staging and marts models. As the last step, it generates dbt docs.
Confirm the sync status in the Airbyte UI.
After dbt jobs completion, check the BigQuery console to see the newly created views in the <span class="text-style-code">transformed_data</span> dataset.
Once the dbt pipeline completes, you can check the dbt docs from the Airflow UI by going to the "Custom Docs" > "dbt" tab.
Congratulations! You've successfully run an end-to-end workflow with Airflow, dbt and Airbyte. üéâ
7. Next Steps
Once you've gone through the steps above, you should have a working Airbyte, dbt and Airflow (ADA) Stack with BigQuery. You can use this as a starting point for your project, and adapt it to your needs. There are lots of things you can do beyond this point, and these tools are evolving fast and adding new features almost every week. Here are some ideas to continue your project:
Expand your data sources
This quickstart uses a very simple data source. Airbyte provides hundreds of sources that might be integrated into your pipeline. And besides configuring and orchestrating them, don't forget to add them as sources in your dbt project. This will make sure you have a lineage graph like the one we showed in the beginning of this document.
Dive into dbt and improve your transformations
dbt is a very powerful tool, and it has lots of features that can help you improve your transformations. You can find more details in the
dbt Documentation
. It's very important that you understand the types of materializations and incremental models, as well as understanding the models, sources, metrics and everything else that dbt provides.
Apply Data Quality into your pipeline
dbt provides a simple test framework that is a good starting point, but there is a lot more you can do to ensure your data is correct.

Documentation Title:
E-commerce Analytics Stack with Airbyte, dbt, Dagster and BigQuery | Airbyte

Documentation Content:
This should trigger the full pipeline. First the Airbyte sync to extract data from Faker and load it into BigQuery, and then dbt to transform the raw data, materializing the staging and marts models.
You can go to the Airbyte UI and confirm a sync is running, and then, once the dbt jobs have run, go to your BigQuery console and check the views have been created in the transformed data dataset.
Next Steps
Congratulations on deploying and running the E-commerce Analytics Quistart! üéâ Here are some suggestions on what you can explore next to dive deeper and get more out of your project:
Explore the Data and Insights
Dive into the datasets in BigQuery, run some queries, and explore the data you've collected and transformed. This is your chance to uncover insights and understand the data better!
Optimize Your dbt Models
Review the transformations you‚Äôve applied using dbt. Try optimizing the models or create new ones based on your evolving needs and insights you want to extract.
Expand Your Data Sources
Add more data sources to Airbyte. Explore different types of sources available, and see how they can enrich your existing datasets and broaden your analytical capabilities.
Enhance Data Quality and Testing
Implement data quality tests in dbt to ensure the reliability and accuracy of your transformations. Use dbt's testing features to validate your data and catch issues early on.
Automate and Monitor Your Pipelines
Explore more advanced Dagster configurations and setups to automate your pipelines further and set up monitoring and alerting to be informed of any issues immediately.
Scale Your Setup
Consider scaling your setup to handle more data, more sources, and more transformations. Optimize your configurations and resources to ensure smooth and efficient processing of larger datasets.
Contribute to the Community
Share your learnings, optimizations, and new configurations with the community. Contribute to the respective tool‚Äôs communities and help others learn and grow.

How to build E-commerce Data Pipeline with Airbyte? | Airbyte

Documentation Content:
This exploration is vital to understand your data's story and its implications.
Optimize the dbt models:
Reflect on the transformations you've implemented using dbt. Is there room for efficiency improvements? Consider optimizing your existing models for performance or scalability.
Additionally, think about new models you could create. As your business needs evolve, so too should your data models. Tailor them to extract deeper or more specific insights that can drive strategic initiatives.
Expand the data sources:
Your data ecosystem is not limited to what you've set up so far. With Airbyte's vast array of connectors, explore adding more data sources. Integrating different types of data can enrich your datasets, offering a more comprehensive view of your business landscape.
Think about social media data, web traffic analytics, customer feedback, and other data sources that could provide a fuller picture of your e-commerce business.
Contribute to the community:
As you learn and improve your setup, consider sharing your experiences with the community. Write blog posts, create tutorials, or contribute to forums.
If you've developed enhancements or new ideas for the Quickstarts repository, consider contributing them back to the
quickstarts GitHub repository
. This not only helps others who are following the same path but also enriches the repository with diverse perspectives and ideas.
