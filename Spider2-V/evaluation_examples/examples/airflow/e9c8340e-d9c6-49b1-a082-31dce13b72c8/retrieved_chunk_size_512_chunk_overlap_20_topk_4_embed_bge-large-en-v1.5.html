Get started with Apache Airflow, Part 1: Write and run your first DAG | Astronomer Documentation

Documentation Content:
Let's trigger a run of the <code>example_astronauts</code>DAG!</p><ol><p>Before you can trigger a DAG run in Airflow, you have to unpause the DAG. To unpause <code>example_astronauts</code>, click the slider button next to its name. Once you unpause it, the DAG starts to run on the schedule defined in its code.</p><p>While all DAGs can run on a schedule defined in their code, you can manually trigger a DAG run at any time from the Airflow UI. Manually trigger <code>example_astronauts</code>by clicking the play button under the <strong>Actions</strong>column. During development, running DAGs on demand can help you identify and resolve issues.</p></ol><p>After you press <strong>Play</strong>, the <strong>Runs</strong>and <strong>Recent Tasks</strong>sections for the DAG start to populate with data.</p><p>These circles represent different <a>states</a>that your DAG and task runs can be in. However, these are only high-level summaries of your runs that won't make much sense until you learn more about how Airflow works. To get a better picture of how your DAG is running, let's explore some other views in Airflow.</p><h2>Step 5: Explore the Airflow UI<a>​</a></h2><p>The navigation bar in the Airflow UI contains tabs with different information about your Airflow environment. For more information about what you can find in each tab, see <a>The Airflow UI</a>.</p><p>Let's explore the available views in the <strong>DAGs</strong>page. To access different DAG views for <code>example_astronauts</code>:</p><ol><li><p>Click the name of the DAG to access the <strong>Grid</strong>view, which shows the status of running and completed tasks.</p><p>Each column in the grid represents a complete DAG run, and each block in the column represents a specific task instance.

Documentation Title:
Run your first DAG with the Astro CLI | Astronomer Documentation

Documentation Content:
See <a>Upgrade the CLI</a>.</p></li><li><p>Run the following command to deploy your DAGs to Astro:</p><span><span>astro deploy </span><span>--dags</span></span><p>This command returns a list of Deployments available in your Workspace and prompts you to confirm where you want to deploy your DAG code. After you select a Deployment, the CLI parses your DAGs to ensure that they don't contain basic syntax and import errors. If your code passes the parse, the Astro CLI deploys your DAGs to Astro. If you run into issues deploying your DAGs, check to make sure that you have the latest version of the Astro CLI. See <a>Upgrade the CLI</a>.</p></li></ol><h2>Step 5: Trigger your DAG on Astro<a>​</a></h2><p>Newly-deployed DAGs are paused by default and will not start running automatically. To run one of the example DAGs in your Astro project according to its schedule, you must unpause it from the Airflow UI hosted on your Deployment.</p><ol><p>In the Deployment page of the Astro UI, click the <strong>Open Airflow</strong>button.</p><p>In the main DAGs view of the Airflow UI, click the slider button next to <code>example-dag-basic</code>to unpause it. If you hover over the DAG, it says <code>DAG is Active</code>. When you do this, the DAG starts to run on the schedule that is defined in its code.</p><li><p>Manually trigger a DAG run of <code>example-dag-basic</code>by clicking the play button in the <strong>Actions</strong>column.
