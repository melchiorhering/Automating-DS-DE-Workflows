Bug fixes
​
Fixed an issue where adding a user to a Workspace and then deleting the user from Astro made it impossible to create new Deployments in that Workspace
Improved error handling in the Airflow UI in cases where a user does not exist or does not have permission to view a Deployment
July 30, 2021
​
Improvements
​
Increased the limit of
Worker Resources
from 30 AU to 175 AU (17.5 CPU, 65.625 GB RAM). If your tasks require this many resources, reach out to us to make sure that your cluster is sized appropriately
Collapsed the
People
and
Teams
tabs on the left-hand navigation bar into a single
Access
tab
Added a
Cluster
field to the Deployments tab in the Astro UI. Now, you can reference which cluster each of your Deployments is in
Replaced our white "A" favicon to one that supports color mode
Informational tooltips are now available in
Deployment Configuration
Bug fixes
​
Fixed an issue where a deleted user could not sign up to Astro again
Removed Deployment-level user roles from the Astro UI. Support for them coming soon
Fixed an issue where a newly created Deployment wouldn't show up on the list of Deployments in the Workspace

​
Support for the Airflow REST API
​
You can now programmatically trigger DAGs and update your Deployments on Astro by making requests to Airflow's
REST API
. Currently this feature works only with temporary tokens, which are available at
cloud.astronomer.io/token
. Support for Deployment API keys is coming soon. For more information on using this feature, read
Airflow API
.
Additional improvements
​
Set
AIRFLOW_HOME = 'usr/local/airflow'
as a permanent global environment variable
In the Astro UI, long environment variable keys and values now wrap to fit the screen
Added links for the Astronomer Registry and certification courses to the left-hand navbar
Moved the
Teams
and
People
tabs into the
Settings
page of the UI
Added
Cluster
information to the metadata section of a Deployment's information page in the UI
Renamed various UI elements to better represent their functionality

Worker Termination Grace Period
from 600 minutes (10 hours) to 1440 minutes (24 hours)
Bug fixes
​
The left-hand navbar in the UI is no longer cut off when minimized on smaller screens
Fixed an issue where you could not delete a Workspace via the UI
Fixed an issue where expired tokens would occasionally appear on
cloud.astronomer.io/token
Fixed an issue where the UI would initially load an inaccurate number of team members on the
Access
page
Fixed alphabetical sorting by name in the
People
tab in the UI
Removed placeholder columns from various tables in the UI

Submit a support request | Astronomer Documentation

Documentation Content:
Additionally, if the immediate problem is solved but there are follow up investigations ongoing, those follow ups will be conducted in a separate ticket at a lower priority.
P2:
High impact. Ability to use Astro is severely impaired but does not affect critical, previously working pipelines in production.
Examples:
A newly deployed production DAG is not working, even though it ran successfully in a development or test environment.
The Airflow UI is unavailable.
You are unable to deploy code to your Deployment, but existing DAGs and tasks are running as expected.
You need to
modify a Hybrid cluster setting
that is required for running tasks, such as adding a new worker instance type.
Task logs are missing in the Airflow UI.
P3:
Medium impact. Service is partially impaired.
Examples:
A newly deployed DAG is not working in a development Deployment, even though it ran successfully in a local environment using the Astro CLI.
You need to
modify a Hybrid cluster setting
that affects your cluster's performance but isn't required to run tasks, such as changing the size of your cluster's database or adding a new VPC peering connection.
Astro CLI usage is impaired (for example, there are incompatibility errors between installed packages).
There is an Airflow issue that has a code-based solution.
You received a log alert on Astronomer.
You have lost the ability to use a
Public Preview
feature that does not affect general services.
P4:
Low impact. Astro is fully usable but you have a question for our team.
Examples:
There are package incompatibilities caused by a specific, complex use case.
You have an inquiry or a small bug report for a Public Preview feature.
Be as descriptive as possible
​
The more information you can provide about the issue you're experiencing, the quicker Astronomer support can start the troubleshooting and resolution process. When submitting a support request, include the following information:
Have you made any recent changes to your Deployment or running DAGs?
What solutions have you already tried?
Is this a problem in more than one Deployment?
Include logs or code snippets
​
If you've already copied task logs or Airflow component logs, send them as a part of your request. The more context you can provide, the better.
