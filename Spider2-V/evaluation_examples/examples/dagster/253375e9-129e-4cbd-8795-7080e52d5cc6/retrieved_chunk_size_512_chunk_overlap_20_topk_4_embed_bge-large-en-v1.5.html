When finished, continue to the next step.</p><h2>Step 3: Convert DAGS into Dagster definitions<span>#</span></h2><p>In this step, you'll start writing Python!</p><p>In the <code>dagster_migration.py</code>file you created in <a>Step 1</a>, use <code>make_dagster_definitions_from_airflow_dags_path</code>and pass in the file path of your Airflow DagBag. Dagster will load the DagBag and convert all DAGs into Dagster jobs and schedules.</p><code><span>import</span>os

That's okay - we'll fix it in a bit. Starting the Dagster UI is the first step in our development loop, allowing you to make a local change, view it in the UI, and debug any errors.</p><ol><li><p>Run the following to start the UI:</p><code>dagster dev -f ./migrate_repo.py
</code></li><p>In your browser, navigate to <a>http://localhost:3001</a>.

If deploying to your infrastructure, refer to the <a>Deployment guides</a>for more info.Additionally, until your Airflow DAGs execute successfully in your local environment, we recommend waiting to move to production.</span><p>In this step, you'll set up your project for use with Dagster+.</p><ol><p>Complete the steps in the <a>Dagster+ Getting Started guide</a>, if you haven't already. Proceed to the next step when your account is set up and you have the <code>dagster-cloud</code>CLI installed.</p><li><p>In the root of your project, create or modify the <a><code>dagster_cloud.yaml</code>file</a>with the following code:</p><code><span>locations</span><span>:</span><span>-</span><span>location_name</span><span>:</span>dagster_migration
    <span>code_source</span><span>:</span><span>python_file</span><span>:</span>dagster_migration.py
</code></li><p>Push your code and let the CI/CD for Dagster+ run out a deployment of your migrated DAGs to cloud.</p></ol><h2>Step 8: Migrate permissions to Dagster<span>#</span></h2><p>Your Airflow instance likely had specific IAM or Kubernetes permissions that allowed it to successfully run your Airflow DAGs. To run the migrated Dagster jobs, you'll need to duplicate these permissions for Dagster.</p><ul><p><strong>We recommend using <a>Airflow connections</a>or <a>environment variables</a></strong>to define permissions whenever possible.</p><p><strong>If you're unable to use Airflow connections or environment variables,</strong>you can attach permissions directly to the infrastructure where you're deploying Dagster.</p><p><strong>If your Airflow DAGs used <code>KubernetesPodOperators</code></strong>, it's possible that you loaded a <code>kube_config</code>file or used the <code>in_cluster</code>config.

Check out the<a>dagster-airflow migration example repo on GitHub</a>!</span><p>Dagster can convert your Airflow DAGs into Dagster jobs, enabling a lift-and-shift migration from Airflow without any rewriting.</p><p>This guide will walk you through the steps of performing this migration.</p><h2>Prerequisites<span>#</span></h2><p>To complete the migration, you'll need:</p><ul><p><strong>To perform some upfront analysis</strong>. Refer to the <a>next section</a>for more detail.</p><li><p><strong>To know the following about your Airflow setup</strong>:</p><ul><li>What operator types are used in the DAGs you're migrating</li><li>What Airflow connections your DAGs depend on</li><li>What Airflow variables you've set</li><li>What Airflow secrets backend you use</li><li>Where the permissions that your DAGs depend on are defined</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>If using Dagster+</strong>, an existing <a>Dagster+</a>account. While your migrated Airflow DAGs will work with Dagster Open Source, this guide includes setup specific to Dagster+.</p><p><strong>If you just signed up for a Dagster+ account</strong>, follow the steps in the <a>Dagster+ Getting Started guide</a>before proceeding.</p></li></ul><h3>Before you begin<span>#</span></h3><p>You may be coming to this document/library in a skeptical frame of mind, having previously been burned by projects that claim to have 100% foolproof, automated migration tools. We want to assure you that we are <em>not</em>making that claim.</p><p>The <code>dagster-airflow</code>migration library should be viewed as a powerful <em>accelerant</em>of migration, rather than guaranteeing completely <em>automated</em>migration. The amount of work required is proportional to the complexity of your installation.
