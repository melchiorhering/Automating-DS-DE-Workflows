Migrating Airflow to Dagster | Dagster Docs

**Note**: Unless the migrated DAGs depend on no Airflow configuration state or permissions, it's unlikely they'll execute correctly at this point. That's okay - we'll fix it in a bit. Starting the Dagster UI is the first step in our development loop, allowing you to make a local change, view it in the UI, and debug any errors.

1. Run the following to start the UI:

`dagster dev -f ./migrate_repo.py`
In your browser, navigate to http://localhost:3001. You should see a list of Dagster jobs that correspond to the DAGs in your Airflow DagBag.

Run one of the simpler jobs, ideally one where you're familiar with the business logic. Note that it's likely to fail due to a configuration or permissions issue.

Using logs to identify and making configuration changes to fix the cause of the failure.


Repeat these steps as needed until the jobs run successfully.

Step 1: Prepare your project for a new Dagster Python module#
-------------------------------------------------------------

While there are many ways to structure an Airflow git repository, this guide assumes you're using a repository structure that contains a single `./dags`DagBag directory that contains all your DAGs.

In the root of your repository, create a `dagster_migration.py`file.

Step 2: Install Dagster Python packages alongside Airflow#
----------------------------------------------------------

This step may require working through a number of version pins. Specifically, installing Airflow 1.x.x versions may be challenging due to (usually) outdated constraint files.Don't get discouraged if you run into problems! Reach out to the Dagster Slack for help.In this step, you'll install the `dagster`, `dagster-airflow`, and `dagster-webserver`Python packages alongside Airflow. **We strongly recommend using a virtualenv.**

To install everything, run:

`pip installdagster dagster-airflow dagster-webserver`We also suggest verifying that you're installing the correct versions of your Airflow dependencies. Verifying the dependency versions will likely save you from debugging tricky errors later.

To check dependency versions, open your Airflow provider's UI and locate the version numbers. When finished, continue to the next step.

Step 3: Convert DAGS into Dagster definitions#
----------------------------------------------

In this step, you'll start writing Python!

In the `dagster_migration.py`file you created in Step 1, use `make_dagster_definitions_from_airflow_dags_path`and pass in the file path of your Airflow DagBag. Dagster will load the DagBag and convert all DAGs into Dagster jobs and schedules.

`importos

fromdagster_airflow import(make_dagster_definitions_from_airflow_dags_path,)migrated_airflow_definitions =make_dagster_definitions_from_airflow_dags_path(os.path.abspath("./dags/"),)`Step 4: Verify the DAGs are loading#
------------------------------------

In this step, you'll spin up Dagster's web-based UI, and verify that your migrated DAGs are loading.

Step 8: Migrate permissions to Dagster#
---------------------------------------

Your Airflow instance likely had specific IAM or Kubernetes permissions that allowed it to successfully run your Airflow DAGs. To run the migrated Dagster jobs, you'll need to duplicate these permissions for Dagster.

**We recommend using Airflow connectionsor environment variables**to define permissions whenever possible.

**If you're unable to use Airflow connections or environment variables,**you can attach permissions directly to the infrastructure where you're deploying Dagster.

**If your Airflow DAGs used `KubernetesPodOperators`**, it's possible that you loaded a `kube_config`file or used the `in_cluster`config. When migrating, we recommend switching to using connections with a `kube_config`JSON blobto make things easier.

=============================

Looking for an example of an Airflow to Dagster migration? Check out thedagster-airflow migration example repo on GitHub!Dagster can convert your Airflow DAGs into Dagster jobs, enabling a lift-and-shift migration from Airflow without any rewriting.

This guide will walk you through the steps of performing this migration.

Prerequisites#
--------------

To complete the migration, you'll need:

**To perform some upfront analysis**. Refer to the next sectionfor more detail.

* **To know the following about your Airflow setup**:


	+ What operator types are used in the DAGs you're migrating
	+ What Airflow connections your DAGs depend on
	+ What Airflow variables you've set
	+ What Airflow secrets backend you use
	+ Where the permissions that your DAGs depend on are defined
* **If using Dagster+**, an existing Dagster+account. While your migrated Airflow DAGs will work with Dagster Open Source, this guide includes setup specific to Dagster+.

**If you just signed up for a Dagster+ account**, follow the steps in the Dagster+ Getting Started guidebefore proceeding.
