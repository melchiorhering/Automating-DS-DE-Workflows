This will be a supervised model since we have the number of comments for all the previous stories.</p><p>The assets graph will look like this at the end of this guide (click to expand):</p><h3>Ingesting data<span>#</span></h3><p>First, we will create an asset that retrieves the most recent Hacker News records.</p><code><span>import</span>requests
