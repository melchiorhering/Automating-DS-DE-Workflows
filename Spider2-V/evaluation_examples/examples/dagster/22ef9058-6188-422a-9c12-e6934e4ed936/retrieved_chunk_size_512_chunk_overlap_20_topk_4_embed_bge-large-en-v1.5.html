Documentation Content:
As more assets are built, this graph will show your entire data platform in one place. This page can also be referred to as the <strong>Global Asset Lineage</strong>.</p><p>Observe that Dagster has detected your <code>topstory_ids</code>asset, but it says that the asset has never been <em>“materialized”</em>.</p><h2>Step 2: Materialize your asset<span>#</span></h2><p>To <strong>materialize</strong>a Software-defined asset means to create or update it. Dagster materializes assets by executing the asset's function or triggering an integration.</p><p>To manually materialize an asset in the UI, click the <strong>Materialize</strong>button in the upper right corner of the screen. This will create a Dagster run that will materialize your assets.</p><p>To follow the progress of the materialization and monitor the logs, each run has a dedicated page. To find the page:</p><ol><p>Click on the <strong>Runs</strong>tab in the upper navigation bar</p><p>Click the value in the <strong>Run ID</strong>column on the table of the Runs page</p><p>The top section displays the progress, and the bottom section live updates with the logs</p></ol><h2>Next steps<span>#</span></h2><p>You've written the first step in your data pipeline! In <a>the next section</a>, you'll learn how to add more assets to your pipeline.
