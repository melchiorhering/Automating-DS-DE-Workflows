</p><p>By the end of this part of the tutorial, you'll be able to:</p><ul><li>Structure your project with code locations and jobs</li><li>Refresh your assets periodically with schedules</li></ul><h2>Step 1: Defining what assets to update<span>#</span></h2><p>A <em>job</em>lets you target a selection of assets to materialize them together as a single action. Assets can belong to multiple jobs.</p><p>Your Dagster repository has a file called <code>tutorial/__init__.py</code>that is used as a top-level definition for your project. Update the code in this file to add the job using the <code>define_asset_job</code>function:</p><code><span>from</span>dagster <span>import</span><span>(</span>AssetSelection<span>,</span>Definitions<span>,</span>define_asset_job<span>,</span>load_assets_from_modules<span>,</span><span>)</span><span>from</span><span>.</span><span>import</span>assets

In the example above, <code>AssetSelection.all</code>selects all assets.</p><p>Once you have a job, you can execute it on a schedule, by clicking a button in the Dagster UI, the CLI, or via Dagster's GraphQL endpoints. Confirm that your job was defined by:</p><ol><li>Going to the UI</li><li>Reloading your project through the <strong>Reload Definitions</strong>button in the asset graph or on the <strong>Deployments</strong>page</li><li>Navigating to <strong>Overview &gt; Jobs</strong></li><li>Clicking on the job</li><li>Seeing your assets selected for the job</li></ol><h3>About definitions<span>#</span></h3><p>Up until this point, you defined assets using the <code>@asset</code>decorator. Dagster definitions are entities that Dagster learns about by importing your code. Just now, you used a different kind of definition: a job definition.</p><p>Managing one type of definition, such as assets, is easy. However, it can quickly become unruly as your project grows to have a variety of definitions (ex. schedules, jobs, sensors). To combine definitions and have them aware of each other, Dagster provides a utility called the <code>Definitions</code>object.</p><h2>Step 2: Scheduling the materializations<span>#</span></h2><p>After defining a job, it can be attached to a schedule. A schedule's responsibility is to start a run of the assigned job at a specified time. Schedules are added with the <code>ScheduleDefinition</code>class.</p><p>To regularly update the assets, add the new <code>ScheduleDefinition</code>import, create a new schedule for the <code>hackernews_job</code>, and add the schedule to the code location.

Jobs can also be run by using the CLI, a Python function, or the UI. Refer to the<a>Jobs documentation</a>to learn more.</span><h3>Other ways to automate your pipelines<span>#</span></h3><p>You've used a schedule to update your data on a regular cadence. However, there are other ways to trigger jobs. For example, sensors can trigger a job after routinely polling a source.
