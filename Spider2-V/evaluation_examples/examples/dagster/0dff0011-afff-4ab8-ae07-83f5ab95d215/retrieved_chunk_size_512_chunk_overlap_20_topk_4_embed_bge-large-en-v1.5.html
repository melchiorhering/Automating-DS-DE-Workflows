Getting started with Dagster+ | Dagster+

Documentation Content:
The starter kit is a template with everything you need to get started using Serverless in Dagster+, including CI/CD configuration and the required <a><code>dagster_cloud.yaml</code>file</a>.</p><ul><p><strong>If using the template</strong>, <a>clone the repository</a>to your local environment.</p><p><strong>If not using the template</strong>, add <code>dagster-cloud</code>as a dependency in <code>setup.py</code>. <a>Click here for an example</a>. This is already done for you if using the starter kit.</p></ul><p>After you've finished setting up your local project, move on to deploying using the CLI:</p><ol><li><p>To install the <code>dagster-plus</code>CLI, run:</p><code>pip <span>install</span>dagster-plus
</code></li><li><p>Next, you'll need to authenticate to Dagster+. Run the following command and follow the prompts to log in:</p><code>dagster-plus config setup
</code></li><li><p>After you've successfully authenticated, run the following to deploy your code to Dagster+:</p><code>dagster-plus serverless deploy <span>\</span>--location-name <span>"&lt;LOCATION_NAME&gt;"</span><span>\</span><span># name of the code loation</span>--package-name <span>"&lt;PACKAGE_NAME&gt;"</span><span>\</span><span># name of the Python package associated with the code location</span></code></li></ol><p>When finished, <a>continue to Step 5</a>.</p></div></div></div></div><div><h3>Hybrid<span>#</span></h3><p>To set up Hybrid deployment and deploy your code, you'll need to:</p><ol><li>Set up an agent</li><li>Configure CI/CD for your project.

jobs, schedules), launch runs, view launched runs, and view assets produced by those runs.</p><h2>Launching the UI<span>#</span></h2><p>The easiest way to launch the UI from the command line during local development is to run:</p><code>dagster dev
</code><p>This command launches both the Dagster webserver (which serves the UI) and the <a>Dagster daemon</a>, allowing you to start a full local deployment of Dagster from the command line.</p><p>The command will print out the URL you can access the UI from in the browser, usually on port 3000.</p><p>When invoked, the UI will fetch definitions - such as assets, jobs, schedules, sensors, and resources - from a <code>Definitions</code>object in a Python module or package or the code locations configured in an open source deployment's <a>workspace files</a>. Refer to the <a>Code location documentation</a>for more info.</p><p>You can also launch the webserver by itself from the command line by running:</p><code>dagster-webserver
</code><p>Note that several Dagster features, like schedules and sensors, require the Dagster daemon to be running in order to function.</p><h2>Overview<span>#</span></h2><ul><p><strong>Description</strong>: This page, also known as the "factory floor", provides a high-level look at the activity in your Dagster deployment, across all code locations.

</p><h2>Understanding the dagster dev command<span>#</span></h2><p>The <code>dagster dev</code>command launches <a>the Dagster webserver/UI</a>and the <a>Dagster daemon</a>, allowing you to start a full deployment of Dagster from the command line.</p><p>This command should be run in a Python environment where the <code>dagster</code>and <code>dagster-webserver</code>packages are installed. <strong>Once started, the process should be kept running.</strong></p><h2>Locating your code<span>#</span></h2><p>Before you can start developing, you need to tell Dagster how to find the Python code containing your assets and jobs. There are a few ways to do this, which are outlined in the tabs below.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: If using an example Dagster project, or if you used the <a><code>dagster</code>CLI to create a project</a>, you can run the <code>dagster dev</code>command in the same folder as the project to load the project code.</p><div><div><button>From a file</button><button>From a module</button><button>Without command line arguments</button></div><div><div><p>Dagster can load a file directly as a code location. In the following example, we used the <code>-f</code>argument to supply the name of the file:</p><code>dagster dev -f my_file.py
</code><p>This command loads the definitions in <code>my_file.py</code>as a code location in the current Python environment.</p><p>You can also include multiple files at a time, where each file will be loaded as a code location:</p><code>dagster dev -f my_file.py -f my_second_file.py
</code></div><div><p>Dagster can also load Python modules as <a>code locations</a>.

Note that the first time you run this, it will take several minutes because a new virtualenv will be constructed.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Line Width</strong>: We use a line width of 100.</li><li><strong>IDE</strong>: We recommend setting up your IDE to format and check with ruff on save, but you can always run <code>make ruff</code>in the root Dagster directory before submitting a pull request. If you're also using VS Code, you can see what we're using for our <code>settings.json</code><a>here</a>.</li><li><strong>Docker</strong>: Some tests require <a>Docker Desktop</a>to be able to run them locally.</li></ul><h2>Developing the Dagster webserver/UI<span>#</span></h2><p>For development, run an instance of the webserver providing GraphQL service on a different port than the webapp, with any pipeline. For example:</p><code><span>cd</span>dagster/examples/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/basics/connecting_ops/
dagster-webserver -p <span>3333</span>-f complex_job.py
</code><p>Keep this running. Then, in another terminal, run the local development (autoreloading, etc.) version of the webapp:</p><code><span>cd</span>dagster/js_modules/dagster-ui
<span>make</span>dev_webapp
</code><p>During development, you might find these commands useful.
