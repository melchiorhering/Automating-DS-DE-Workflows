Summary and key points
¶
In summary, you used a pre-loaded template worksheet in Snowsight to complete the following steps:
Set the role and warehouse to use.
Create a database, schema, and table.
Create a storage integration and configure permissions on cloud storage.
Create a stage and load the data from the stage into the table.
Query the data.
Here are some key points to remember about loading and querying data:
You need the required permissions to create and manage objects in your account. In this tutorial,
you use the ACCOUNTADMIN system role for these privileges.
This role is not normally used to create objects. Instead, we recommend creating a hierarchy of
roles aligned with business functions in your organization. For more information, see
Using the ACCOUNTADMIN Role
.
You need a warehouse for the resources required to create and manage objects and run SQL commands.
This tutorial uses the
compute_wh
warehouse included with your trial account.
You created a database to store the data and a schema to group the database objects logically.
You created a storage integration and a stage to load data from a CSV file stored in an AWS S3 bucket.
After the data was loaded into your database, you queried it using a SELECT statement.

Documentation Title:
Load and query sample data using SQL | Snowflake Documentation

Documentation Content:
This tutorial creates
a stage that loads data from an Amazon S3 bucket. This tutorial uses an existing bucket with
a CSV file that contains the data. You load the data from this CSV file into the table you created
previously. For information, see
Bulk loading from Amazon S3
.
To create a stage, do the following:
In the open worksheet, place your cursor in the CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE lines, then select
Run
.
CREATE
OR
REPLACE
STAGE
tasty_bytes_sample_data
.
public
.
blob_stage
url
=
's3://sfquickstarts/tastybytes/'
file_format
=
(
type
=
csv
);
Copy
To confirm that the stage was created successfully, place your cursor in the LIST line,
then select
Run
.
LIST
@
tasty_bytes_sample_data
.
public
.
blob_stage
/
raw_pos
/
menu
/;
Copy
Your output looks similar to the following image.
To load the data into the table, place your cursor in the COPY INTO lines, then select
Run
.
COPY
INTO
tasty_bytes_sample_data
.
raw_pos
.
menu
FROM
@
tasty_bytes_sample_data
.
public
.
blob_stage
/
raw_pos
/
menu
/;
Copy
Step 6. Query the data
¶
Now that the data is loaded, you can run queries on the
menu
table.
To run a query in the open worksheet, select the line or lines of the SELECT command,
and then select
Run
.
For example, to return the number of rows in the table, run the following query:
SELECT
COUNT
(*)
AS
row_count
FROM
tasty_bytes_sample_data
.
raw_pos
.
menu
;
Copy
Your output looks similar to the following image.
Run this query to return the top ten rows in the table:
SELECT
TOP
10
*
FROM
tasty_bytes_sample_data
.
raw_pos
.
menu
;
Copy
Your output looks similar to the following image.
For more information about running a query that returns the specified number of rows,
see
TOP <n>
.
You can run other queries in the worksheet to explore the data in the
menu
table.
Step 7.

For more information, see
Using the ACCOUNTADMIN Role
.
A warehouse provides the compute resources that you need to execute DML operations, load data,
and run queries. These resources include CPU, memory, and temporary storage. Your
trial account has a virtual warehouse (
compute_wh
) that you can use for this
tutorial. For more information, see
Virtual warehouses
.
To set the role and warehouse to use, do the following:
In the open worksheet, place your cursor in the USE ROLE line.
USE
ROLE
accountadmin
;
Copy
In the upper-right corner of the worksheet, select
Run
.
Note
In this tutorial, run SQL statements one at a time. Do not select
Run All
.
Place your cursor in the USE WAREHOUSE line, then select
Run
.
USE
WAREHOUSE
compute_wh
;
Copy
Step 4. Set up a table that you can load
¶
A database is a repository for your data. The data is stored in tables that you can
manage and query. A schema is a logical grouping of database objects, such as tables
and views. For example, a schema might contain the database objects required for a
specific application. For more information, see
Databases, Tables and Views - Overview
.
To create a database, a schema, and a table that you can load, do the following:
In the open worksheet, place your cursor in the CREATE OR REPLACE DATABASE line,
enter a name for your database and an optional comment, then select
Run
. For
example:
CREATE
OR
REPLACE
DATABASE
cloud_data_db
COMMENT
=
'Database for loading cloud data'
;
Copy
Place your cursor in the CREATE OR REPLACE SCHEMA line, enter a name for your schema
and an optional comment, then select
Run
. For example:
CREATE
OR
REPLACE
SCHEMA
cloud_data_db
.
s3_data
COMMENT
=
'Schema for tables loaded from S3'
;
Copy
Place your cursor in the CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE lines, complete the table
definition, add an optional comment, and select
Run
.

For example, a schema might
contain the database objects required for a specific application. For more information,
see
Databases, Tables and Views - Overview
.
In this tutorial, you create a database named
tasty_bytes_sample_data
, a
schema named
raw_pos
, and a table named
menu
.
To create the database, schema, and table, do the following:
In the open worksheet, place your cursor in the CREATE OR REPLACE DATABASE line,
then select
Run
.
CREATE
OR
REPLACE
DATABASE
tasty_bytes_sample_data
;
Copy
Place your cursor in the CREATE OR REPLACE SCHEMA line, then select
Run
.
CREATE
OR
REPLACE
SCHEMA
tasty_bytes_sample_data
.
raw_pos
;
Copy
Place your cursor in the CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE lines, then select
Run
.
CREATE
OR
REPLACE
TABLE
tasty_bytes_sample_data
.
raw_pos
.
menu
(
menu_id
NUMBER
(

,
0
),
menu_type_id
NUMBER
(

),
menu_type
VARCHAR
(

),
truck_brand_name
VARCHAR
(

),
menu_item_id
NUMBER
(

,
0
),
menu_item_name

),
sale_price_usd
NUMBER
(

);
Copy
To confirm that the table was created successfully, place your cursor in the SELECT line,
then select
Run
.
SELECT
*
FROM
tasty_bytes_sample_data
.
raw_pos

menu
;
Copy
Your output shows the columns of the table you created. At this point in the tutorial, the
table does not have any rows.
Step 5. Create a stage and load the data
¶
A stage is a location that holds data files to load into a Snowflake database. This tutorial creates
a stage that loads data from an Amazon S3 bucket.
