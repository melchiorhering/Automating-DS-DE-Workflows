Data Collaboration Updates
¶
Listing Discovery Controls —
General Availability
¶
With this release, we are pleased to announce the general availability of listing discovery controls, which let you offer listings that can
only be discovered by specific consumers, similar to a direct share.
Using privately discoverable listings instead of direct shares lets you auto-fulfill your data product across clouds and Snowflake regions,
gather metrics about consumer usage of the data, and include metadata with your data share, such as a title and description, and usage
examples to help consumers use the data quickly.
For more information, refer to
About Listings
.
Web Interface Updates
¶
SQL Editor Improvements —–
General Availability
¶
With this release, we are pleased to announce the general availability of improvements to the SQL editor in Snowsight,
including the following:
Improved find and replace functionality.
Redesigned autocomplete for commands, columns, and objects.
Updated function autocomplete, including suggestions for function arguments to make it easier to write user-defined functions.
Added highlighting for selected keywords, so that when you select a term in the SQL editor, all other instances of the term appear highlighted.

Documentation Title:
Managing data listings | Snowflake Documentation

Documentation Content:
Link to Documentation
A link to a page on provider’s website with more detailed documentation. Documentation must be clear and reference the right schema objects present in the Snowflake share. It cannot be just standard documentation.
https://developer.example.com
Data
Database Objects or Secure Share
Select data you wish to share. This section is only available for free data listings.
Business Needs
Business Need
Data listings are grouped by business needs for easy discovery.
.
- You can select up to six business needs for your listing. If you do not see a relevant business need in the drop-down list, you can create a custom one.
.
- Consumers can easily discover listings based on business needs available in the drop-down list. However, custom business needs you add are not included, and are only visible in your listing details.
Description
Description of how your data or data service addresses the business need.
Sample SQL Query
Title
Descriptive title for the query to help consumers understand the data. You can add more than one example.
Description (Optional)
Description of the example with additional instructions, e.g. name of the schema, sample tables, fields, use cases.
SQL Query
Test sample queries against the database you use to create the share. Snowflake auto-validates the queries to ensure that all referenced objects are added to the share and the queries run successfully. If the validation fails, an error message with a reason is displayed. You can see an exclamation sign next to each query that failed.
Region Availability
All available regions
or
Specific Regions
Regions where your listing will be visible. You will need to replicate the data to these regions. You can edit the list of available regions at any time without resubmitting it for administrator’s approval. If you remove a region that was previously available, consumers in that region will no longer be able to see the listing.
Viewing requests for personalized listings
¶
Note
Email notifications are sent to providers to notify them of data requests. You can change the request notification email for a specific listing in the
Settings
tab.
To view requests for personalized listings:

Data Products
