Loading data using Snowsight
¶
You can use Snowsight to load files for the following scenarios:
Loading a file or multiple files from your local machine into an existing table.
Loading a file from a stage into an existing table.
Creating a new table when loading a local or staged file. Snowsight uses the
INFER_SCHEMA
table function to automatically detect the file metadata schema, retrieve the column definitions, and generate a new table. This feature doesn’t support XML files.
You can load data from individual files up to 250 MB in size.
Note
To use Snowsight to load data, you must use a role that has the OWNERSHIP privilege on the table that you want to load data into and the USAGE privilege on the database and schema that contain the table. See
Table privileges
.
If you want to use a
named file format
, your role must also have the USAGE privilege on that specific file format.

function.
Review the inferred file format, data type, column name, and a sample of column data. Ensure all information is accurate and make updates if needed.
Select
Load
.
Snowsight loads the file and creates a new table for the file.
Loading data using Classic Console
¶
The Classic Console provides a wizard for loading limited amounts of data into a table from a small set of files.
The wizard performs the same PUT and COPY operations that you would using SQL, but combines the two phases (staging files and loading data)
into a single operation and deleting all staged files after the load completes.
You can load data from files on your local machine or files already staged in an existing cloud storage location on Snowflake, Amazon S3,
Google Cloud Storage, or Microsoft Azure.
Prerequisites for loading data
¶
Before you start loading data using Classic Console, do the following:
Identify the location your data files. You can load data from one of the following:
Your local machine.
An internal or external stage.
