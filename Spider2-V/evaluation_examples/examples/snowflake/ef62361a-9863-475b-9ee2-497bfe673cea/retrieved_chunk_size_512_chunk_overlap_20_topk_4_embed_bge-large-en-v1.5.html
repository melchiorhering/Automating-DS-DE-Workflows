You can only add one worksheet at a time to Snowsight, and the user who adds the recovered worksheets to
Snowsight becomes the new owner of the worksheets.</p><p>See <span>Create worksheets from a SQL file</span>for details.</p></section><section><h3>Considerations for recovering worksheets owned by dropped users<a>¶</a></h3><p>Considerations when recovering worksheets:</p><ul><p>Only the title and contents of the most recently executed version of a worksheet are recovered. Worksheet version history,
sharing recipients and permissions, query results, and worksheet metadata are not recovered.</p><p>A maximum of 500 worksheets are recovered. For dropped users with more than 500 worksheets, only the 500 most recently modified worksheets
are recovered.</p><p>Only worksheets in Snowsight are recovered. Worksheets in Classic Console owned by dropped users cannot be recovered with
this method.</p><p>If multiple dropped users have the same username, worksheets owned by all dropped users with that username are recovered.</p></ul><p>If the worksheet recovery fails for unexpected reasons, contact <a>Snowflake Support</a>.</p></section></section><section><h2>Internal Snowflake objects for worksheets<a>¶</a></h2><p>Snowflake creates the following internal objects to support using worksheets in Snowsight:</p><table><tr><p>Object Type</p><p>Name</p></tr><tbody><tr><p>Security integration</p><p>WORKSHEETS</p></tr><tr><p>Blobs</p><p>WORKSHEETS_APP</p></tr><tr><p>Database</p><p>WORKSHEETS_APP</p></tr><tr><p>User</p><p>WORKSHEETS_APP_USER</p></tr><tr><p>Roles</p><p>APPADMIN, WORKSHEETS_APP_RL</p></tr></tbody></table><p>These internal objects are used to cache query results in an internal stage in your account.
