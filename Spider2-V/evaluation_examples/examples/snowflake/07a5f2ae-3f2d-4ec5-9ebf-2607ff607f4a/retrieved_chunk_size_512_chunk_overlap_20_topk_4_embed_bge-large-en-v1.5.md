Bulk loading from Amazon S3 | Snowflake Documentation

Documentation Content:
Regardless of the method you use, this step requires a running, current virtual warehouse for the session if you execute the command
manually or within a script. The warehouse provides the compute resources to perform the actual insertion of rows into the table.

!Note

Snowflake uses Amazon S3 Gateway Endpoints in each of its Amazon Virtual Private Clouds.

If the S3 bucket referenced by your external stage is in the same region as your Snowflake account, your network traffic does not traverse the public Internet. The Amazon S3 Gateway Endpoints ensure that regional traffic stays within the AWS network.

Tip

The instructions in this set of topics assume you have read Preparing to load dataand have created a named file format, if desired.

Before you begin, you may also want to read Data loading considerationsfor best practices, tips, and other guidance.

Documentation Content:
What you will learn¶

In this tutorial you will learn how to:

Use a role that has the privileges to create and use the Snowflake objects required by this tutorial.

Use a warehouse to access resources.

Create a database and schema.

Create a table.

Create a storage integration for your cloud platform.

Prerequisites¶
--------------

This tutorial assumes the following:

You have a supported browser.

You have a trial account. If you do not have a trial account yet, you can sign up
for a free trial.
You can choose any Snowflake Cloud Region.

* You have an account that you can use to bulk load data from one of the following
cloud providers:


	AWS S3. See Bulk loading from Amazon S3.
	
	Microsoft Azure. See Bulk loading from Microsoft Azure.
	
	Google Cloud Storage. See Bulk loading from Google Cloud Storage.

Note

This tutorial is only available to users with a trial account. The sample worksheet is not available
for other types of accounts.

Step 1. Sign in using Snowsight¶
--------------------------------

To access Snowsight over the public Internet, do the following:

In a supported web browser, navigate to https://app.snowflake.com.

Provide your account identifieror account URL.
If you’ve previously signed in to Snowsight, you might see an account name that you can select.

Sign in using your Snowflake account credentials.

Step 2. Open the Load data from cloud storage worksheet¶
--------------------------------------------------------

You can use worksheets to write and run SQL commands on your database. Your trial
account has access to a template worksheet for this tutorial. The worksheet has the SQL
commands that you will run to create database objects, load data, and query the
data. Because it is a template worksheet, you will be invited to enter your own values
for certain SQL parameters. For more information about worksheets,
see Getting started with worksheets.

The worksheet for this tutorial is not pre-loaded into the trial account. To open
the worksheet for this tutorial, follow these steps:

DOCUMENTATION/Getting StartedGuidesDeveloperReferenceReleasesTutorialsStatus### Tutorial: Bulk loading from Amazon S3 using COPY

Getting StartedTutorialsBulk LoadingBulk Loading from Amazon S3 Using COPYTutorial: Bulk loading from Amazon S3 using COPY¶
=================================================

Introduction¶
-------------

This tutorial describes how to load data from files in an existing Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket into a table. In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

Create named file formats that describe your data files.

Create named stage objects.

Load data located in your S3 bucket into Snowflake tables.

Resolve errors in your data files.


The tutorial covers loading of both CSV and JSON data.

Prerequisites¶
--------------

The tutorial assumes the following:

You have a Snowflake account that is configured to use Amazon Web Services (AWS) and a user with a role that grants the necessary
privileges to create a database, tables, and virtual warehouse objects.

You have SnowSQL installed.


Refer to the Snowflake in 20 minutesfor instructions to meet these requirements.

Snowflake provides sample data files in a public Amazon S3 bucket for use in this tutorial.
But before you start, you need to create a database, tables, and a virtual warehouse for
this tutorial. These are the basic Snowflake objects needed for most Snowflake activities.

====================

To explore the tutorials listed below, you must have a Snowflake account and a user with the required roles (ACCOUNTADMIN and
SYSADMIN) and access to a virtual warehouse:

If you have signed up for a trial account, the trial account user has the required
roles and a virtual warehouse (compute\_wh) that you can use for these tutorials.

Otherwise, if you use another account to explore these tutorials, you must log in as a user that has been granted the required
roles and that can use a virtual warehouse.


Snowflake provides the following tutorials.

For new users, Snowflake in 20 minutes. This is a simple tutorial in which you use SnowSQL (the Snowflake
command line client) to learn about key concepts and tasks.
