    "instruction": "I want to get the average salary of Data Analyst from table SALARY in database DB and schema PUBLIC. Since I may subsequently query the average salary of other jobs, I would like to create a custom filter and use that filter to query the average salary of the corresponding job. Please help me to create the required filter. Then create a new SQL worksheet, copy the query statement containing the filter from query.txt on the desktop to the worksheet, and use the filter to query the average salary for the job title Data Analyst. Finally, you need to download the results of the query and rename it to result.csv. Specific details about the filter are given below:\n- Display Name: Title_Keyword\n- SQL Keyword: :title_keyword\n- Role: ACCOUNTADMIN\n- Warehouse: COMPUTE_WH\n- Options via: Query\nHere is a step-by-step tutorial from an expert instructing you how to complete it:\nThis task is to create a custom filter to filter the query results. In the opened Snowsight web page,\n1. On the top-left of the worksheet, click the filter button which has an icon with two horizontal lines.\n2. On the drop-down menu, click \"Manage Filters\".\n3. On the top-right of the pop-up window, click \"+ Filter\" button.\n4. Type in \"Title_Keyword\" to the input field \"Display Name\".\n5. Type in \"title_keyword\" to the input field \"SQL Keyword\".\n6. Select \"COMPUTE_WH\" for the \"Warehouse\".\n7. Click the blue button \"Write Query\" below.\n8. In the pop-up window, Select \"DB >> PUBLIC\".\n9. Copy the code below to the filter query edit field.\n```\nSELECT distinct job_title from salary;\n```\n10. Click \"Run\" button on the top-right. There will be several job titles on the result field.\n11. Click \"Done\" button on the top-left.\n12. Click \"Save\" button on the bottom-right.\n13. Click \"Done\" button on the bottom-right.\n14. Copy the query from query.txt on the desktop to the worksheet. The contents of query.txt are also given below.\n```\nSELECT avg(salary) as average_salary from salary where job_title = :title_keyword;\n```\n15. Click \"Title_Keyword\" button on the top of the worksheet.\n16. In the drop-down menu, Select the second option \"Data Analyst\".\n17. Click \"No Database selected\" button on the top of the worksheet, then select \"DB >> PUBLIC\".\n18. Click \"Apply\" button just to the right of the \"Title_Keyword\" button.\n19. Click the \"Download Results\" button on the top-right of the result panel.\n20. In the drop-down menu, click \"Download as .csv\".\n21. In your virtual machine, navigate to the /home/user/Download directory.\n22. Rename the downloaded file to \"result.csv\".\nYou can exactly follow the detailed plan above or proactively tackle the task based on the real-time environment interaction by yourself.",
