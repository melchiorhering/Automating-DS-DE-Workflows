to return to the current version of the worksheet.
If you want to view the results of a past worksheet run, view the Query History for the worksheet.

Stored results for past worksheet versions
¶
Note
Available to most accounts. Accounts in U.S. government regions, accounts using Virtual Private Snowflake (VPS), and accounts
that use Private Connectivity to access Snowflake continue to see query results limited to 10,000 rows.
All results for queries executed in worksheets are available for up to 24 hours. After 24 hours, you must run your query again to view
results.
To support contextual statistics and sharing worksheet results, the query results are cached for up to 90 days, or 25 worksheet versions,
whichever is greater. This cache is included in the data storage usage for your account.
Recover worksheets owned by a dropped user
¶
If you drop a user, you can recover up to 500 of the worksheets owned by that user. To recover the worksheets, do the following:
Download recovered worksheets
owned by a dropped user.
Create worksheets from a SQL file
to add the recovered worksheets back to Snowflake.
If you want to change ownership or retain access to worksheets before dropping a user, ask that user to share the worksheets.
See
Sharing worksheets and folders
.
Download recovered worksheets owned by a dropped user
¶
To recover worksheets owned by a dropped user, download a
.tar.gz
archive file of up to 500 worksheets owned by that user.
Note
You must be granted the ACCOUNTADMIN role to recover worksheets of dropped users.
Sign in to Snowsight.
Select
Projects
»
Worksheets
.
Select
»
Recover Worksheets from Dropped User
.
In the dialog box, enter the username of a dropped user in your account.
Important
The case and spelling of the username must exactly match the username as it was stored in Snowflake.
Select
Recover
.
Your web browser downloads a
.tar
file containing up to 500 worksheets. If the dropped user has more than 500 worksheets,
only the 500 most recently modified worksheets are downloaded.

Backing Up Your Own Worksheets
¶
We recommend that users back up complex or crucial worksheets that would be difficult to recreate. Copy and paste the contents of individual worksheets into files that you can safeguard. Backing up your worksheets prevents them from accidental deletion.
Worksheet metadata is stored in the Snowflake user stage, in the
worksheet_data
directory. Executing the
REMOVE
command and removing the
worksheet_data
directory deletes your own worksheets, which cannot be restored.
Note
This precaution applies to worksheets in the
Worksheets
tab in the Classic Console only.
Worksheets in
Snowsight
are stored elsewhere and are not prone to accidental deletion.

How do I see query details from my worksheet?
¶
After you run a SQL query, when you view the
Results
, you can select the
Query Details
to see information about your query,
such as the bytes scanned and the end time.
To review the queries that have been run in the worksheet, as well as the results for those queries, select
(
Query history
).
For more details, see
View query history
. If you open the query details, you open the query profile for the
query. See
Review Query Profile
.
Where is my account info?
¶
To retrieve your account information, such as to copy the account identifier to sign in to SnowSQL, the Snowflake VS Code Extension, or
another connection to Snowflake, you can use the account menu in Snowsight:
Open the account selector and review the list of accounts that you previously signed in to.
Locate the account for which you want to copy the account name.
Hover over the account to view additional details, and then select the copy icon to copy the account identifier in the format
<orgname>.<account_name>
to your clipboard.
You can also copy the account URL and review additional details, such as the name of your Snowflake organization, the edition of your
account, and your Snowflake region.
Import worksheets from the Classic Console
¶
You can import your SQL worksheets from the Classic Console to Snowsight from within Snowsight.
Import your SQL worksheets to make it easier to refer to queries and SQL statements that you’ve written in the past,
without needing to switch to a different web interface and session.
Note
You can import your worksheets to Snowsight even if you can no longer access the Classic Console.
To import your SQL worksheets to Snowsight, do the following:
Sign in to Snowsight.
Select
Projects
»
Worksheets
.
Select the
…
more menu »
Import Worksheets
.
In the confirmation dialog, select
Import
.
Snowflake creates a folder named
Import YYYY-MM-DD
and places all worksheets from the Classic Console in that folder.
Important
Snowsight has a maximum worksheet size of 1MB. Worksheets larger than 1MB fail to import.
