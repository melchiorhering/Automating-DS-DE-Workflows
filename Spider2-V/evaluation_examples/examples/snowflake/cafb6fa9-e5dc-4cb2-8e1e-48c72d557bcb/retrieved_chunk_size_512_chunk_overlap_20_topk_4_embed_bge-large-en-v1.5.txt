Load and query sample data using SQL | Snowflake Documentation

Documentation Content:
Provide your
account identifier
or account URL.
If you’ve previously signed in to Snowsight, you might see an account name that you can select.
Sign in using your Snowflake account credentials.
Step 2. Open the SQL worksheet for loading and querying data
¶
You can use worksheets to write and run SQL commands on your Snowflake database. Your trial account has access
to a pre-loaded worksheet for this tutorial. The worksheet has the SQL commands that
you will run to create a database, load data into it, and query the data. For more information
about worksheets, see
Getting started with worksheets
.
To open the pre-loaded tutorial worksheet:
Select
Projects
»
Worksheets
to open the list of worksheets.
Open
[Tutorial] Using SQL to load and query sample data
.
Your worksheet looks similar to the following image.
Step 3. Set the role and warehouse to use
¶
The role you use determines the privileges you have. In this tutorial, use the
ACCOUNTADMIN system role so that you can view and manage objects in your account.
For more information, see
Using the ACCOUNTADMIN Role
.
A warehouse provides the required resources to create and manage objects and run
SQL commands. These resources include CPU, memory, and temporary storage. Your
trial account has a virtual warehouse (
compute_wh
) that you can use for this
tutorial. For more information, see
Virtual warehouses
.
To set the role and warehouse to use, do the following:
In the open worksheet, place your cursor in the USE ROLE line.
USE
ROLE
accountadmin
;
Copy
In the upper-right corner of the worksheet, select
Run
.
Note
In this tutorial, run SQL statements one at a time. Do not select
Run All
.
Place your cursor in the USE WAREHOUSE line, then select
Run
.
USE
WAREHOUSE
compute_wh
;
Copy
Step 4. Create a database, schema, and table
¶
A database stores data in tables that you can manage and query. A schema is a logical
grouping of database objects, such as tables and views. For example, a schema might
contain the database objects required for a specific application.

Insert additional data rows
¶
In addition to loading data from staged files into a table, you can insert rows directly into a table using the
INSERT
DML command.

Using the Sample Database | Snowflake Documentation

Documentation Content:
For example, in SQL:
show databases
like
'%sample%'
;

-------------------------------+-----------------------+------------+------------+-------------------------+--------------+---------+---------+----------------+
| created_on                    | name                  | is_default | is_current | origin                  | owner        | comment | options | retention_time |

-------------------------------+-----------------------+------------+------------+-------------------------+--------------+---------+---------+----------------+
Copy
Note that this example illustrates the sample database, SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA, has been
shared with your account
by Snowflake.
The
origin
column in the SHOW DATABASES output (or the
Origin
column in the
Databases
page in the interface) displays the fully-qualified name of the shared
database, SFC_SAMPLES.SAMPLE_DATA, indicating it originated from the SFC_SAMPLES account (used by Snowflake to share the sample data).
Querying Tables and Views in the Sample Database
¶
To use a table or view in the sample database, you can either:
Reference the fully-qualified name of the table in your query (in the form of
snowflake_sample_data.
schema_name
.
object_name
).
OR
Specify the sample database (and schema) for your session using the
USE DATABASE
and/or
USE SCHEMA
commands.
The following two examples illustrate using both approaches to query the
lineitem
table in the
tpch_sf1
schema:
select
count
(*)
from
snowflake_sample_data
.
tpch_sf1
.
lineitem
;
+
----------+
| COUNT(*) |
|----------|
|  6001215 |
+
----------+
use
schema
snowflake_sample_data
.
tpch_sf1
;
select
count
(*)
from
lineitem
;
+
----------+
| COUNT(*) |
|----------|
|  6001215 |
+
----------+
Copy
Note
You must have a running, current warehouse in your session to perform queries.

Returning Information About the Match
¶
Basic Match Information
¶
In many cases, you want your query to list not only information from the table that contains the data, but also
information about the patterns that were found. When you want information about the matches themselves, you specify
that information in the
MEASURES
clause.
