With a worksheet, you can do any of the following:</p><ul><p>Run ad hoc queries and other DDL/DML operations.</p><p>Write Snowpark Python code in a Python worksheet.</p><p>Review the query history and results of queries that you executed.</p><p>Examine multiple worksheets, each with its own separate session.</p><p>Export the results for a selected statement, while results are still available.</p></ul><p>For more details, see:</p><ul><span>Getting started with worksheets</span><span>Managing and using worksheets in Snowsight</span><span>Querying data using worksheets</span><span>Writing Snowpark Code in Python Worksheets</span></ul></section><section><h2>Visualize query results with charts and dashboards<a>¶</a></h2><p>When you run a query in Snowsight, you can choose to view your results as a chart. You can also create a collection of charts
as a <span>Dashboard</span>, allowing you to review your data more easily. Dashboards provide flexible collections of charts arranged as tiles.
Dashboard charts start with SQL to generate results and associated charts. You can share these charts with others, modify the charts,
and display them as dashboard tiles.</p><p>To learn more about charts, see <span>Visualizing worksheet data</span>.

better sense of the smoothing effect of calculations with sliding window frames.
In the query worksheet, click the <span>Chart</span>button next to <span>Results</span>.</p><p>For example, the yellow line in the bar chart shows a much smoother trend for average
temperature versus the blue line for the raw temperature.</p><p>Other window functions, such as the
<span>LEAD</span>and <span>LAG</span>ranking functions,
are also commonly used in time-series analysis. Use the LEAD window function to find the next data point in the time series,
relative to the current data point, and the LAG function to find the previous data point.</p></section><section><h3>Using the MIN_BY and MAX_BY aggregate functions<a>¶</a></h3><p>The ability to select one column based on the minimum or maximum value of another column in the
same row is a common requirement for SQL developers who are working with time-series data.

Filter query results in dashboards and worksheets | Snowflake Documentation

Documentation Content:
</p></ul><p>When you add filters to your query, corresponding filter buttons appear at the top of your worksheet or dashboard:</p><p>To manipulate the results that you see from your query, use the filters to select specific values.</p><p>For this example, set the <span>Group by</span>filter, which corresponds to the date bucket filter, to group by <span>Day</span>. Set the other
filter, which corresponds to the date range filter, to <code><span>All</span><span>time</span></code>.</p><p>When you select <span>Apply</span>and apply the filter to your results, the results are grouped by day and results like the following output
appear:</p><pre><span>+--------+------------+</span><span>| orders |  buckets   |</span><span>+--------+------------+</span><span>|    621 | 1992-01-01 |</span><span>|    612 | 1992-01-02 |</span><span>|    598 | 1992-01-03 |</span><span>|    670 | 1992-01-04 |</span><span>+--------+------------+</span></pre><p>You can select a different date bucket to show a different grouping of data. For example, to view weekly order data, set the <span>Group by</span>filter to <span>Week</span>and select <span>Apply</span>.
