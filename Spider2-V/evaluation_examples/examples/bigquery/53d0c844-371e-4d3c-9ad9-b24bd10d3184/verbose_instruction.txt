In this task, we will use Bigquery Web UI to write code to query `covid19_open_data` public dataset and save the execution results into a local .csv file. Concretely,
1. Click the triangle symbol to the left of covid19_open_data to open the datasets and see what tables the datasets have.
2. Click `covid19_open_data` to see the table schema.
3. Click '+' button at the top of the main panel to **Create SQL query**. This will open a blank query panel.
4. Write the following code into the blank
```
SELECT
  SUM(cumulative_confirmed) AS total_cases_worldwide
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
WHERE
  date = "2020-04-15"
```
5. Click the "> RUN" button in the menu bar of this panel to execute this SQL;
6. Wait for a moment. The query results will show below.
7. Click the "SAVE RESULTS" button above the execution results (on the right side of the same row as panel "Query results");
8. And in the drop-down menu, further click the option "CSV (local file)";
9. Open the terminal and move to the `~/Downloads` folder
10. Change the name of the csv file to result.csv
