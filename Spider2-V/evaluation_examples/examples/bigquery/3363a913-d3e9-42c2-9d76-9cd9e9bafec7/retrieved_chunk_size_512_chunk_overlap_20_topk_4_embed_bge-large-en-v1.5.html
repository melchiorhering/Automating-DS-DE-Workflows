The data is processed by Citi Bike to remove trips that are
taken by staff to service and inspect the system and any trips below 60
seconds in length, which are considered false starts.</p><p>You can start exploring this data in the BigQuery console by
viewing the details of the <code>citibike_stations</code>table:</p><a>Go to citibike_stations schema</a><p>Three columns in this table are relevant to this tutorial:</p><ul><li><code>bike_stations.longitude</code>: the longitude of a station. The values are
valid WGS 84 longitudes in decimal degrees format.</li><li><code>bike_stations.latitude</code>: the latitude of a station. The values are
valid WGS 84 latitudes in decimal degrees format.</li><li><code>num_bikes_available</code>: the number of bikes available for rental.</li></ul><h2>Query the bike stations with more than 30 bikes available</h2><p>In this section of the tutorial, you run a GoogleSQL query that finds all the
Citi Bike stations in New York City with more than 30 bikes available to rent.</p><h3>Query details</h3><p>The following GoogleSQL query is used to find the Citi Bike stations with
more than 30 bikes.</p><pre>SELECT

FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.new_york.citibike_stations`

</pre><p>The query clauses do the following:</p><ul><dl><code>SELECT ST_GeogPoint(longitude, latitude)  AS WKT, num_bikes_available</code><dd>The <code>SELECT</code>clause selects the <code>num_bikes_available</code>column and uses the
<code>ST_GeogPoint</code>function to convert the values in the <code>latitude</code>and <code>longitude</code>columns to <code>GEOGRAPHY</code>types (points).
