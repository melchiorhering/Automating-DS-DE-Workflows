The query takes a moment to complete. After the query runs, your results
appear in the
Query results
pane.
Visualize the query results in Geo Viz
Next, you visualize your results using BigQuery Geo Viz: a
web tool for visualization of geospatial data in BigQuery using
Google Maps APIs.
Launch Geo Viz and authenticate
Before using Geo Viz, you must authenticate and grant access to data in
BigQuery.
To set up Geo Viz:
Open the Geo Viz web tool.
Open the Geo Viz web tool
You might need to enable cookies to authorize and use this tool.
Under step one,
Query
, click
Authorize
.
In the
Choose an account
dialog, click your Google Account.
In the access dialog, click
Allow
to give Geo Viz access to your
BigQuery data.
Run a GoogleSQL query on geospatial data
After you authenticate and grant access, the next step is to run the query in
Geo Viz.
To run the query:
For step one,
Select data
, enter your project ID in the
Project ID
field.
In the query window, enter the following GoogleSQL query.
-- Finds Citi Bike stations with > 30 bikes
SELECT
  ST_GeogPoint(longitude, latitude)  AS WKT,
  num_bikes_available
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.new_york.citibike_stations`
WHERE num_bikes_available > 30
Click
Run
.
When the query completes, click
Show results
. You can also click step two
Define columns
.
This moves you to step two. In step two, for
Geometry column
, choose
WKT
. This plots the points corresponding to the bike stations on your
map.
Format your visualization
The Style section provides a list of visual styles for customization. Certain
properties apply only to certain types of data. For example,
circleRadius
affects only points.
Supported style properties include:
fillColor
. The fill color of a polygon or point. For example,
"linear" or "interval" functions can be used to map numeric values to a color
gradient.
fillOpacity
.

Query details
This query extracts data on cycle hires, including
start_station_name
, and
duration
and joins it against station information, including
distance-from-city-center
. Then, it computes attributes of
the station in
stationstats
, including the average duration of rides and the
number of trips, and passes through the station attribute
distance_from_city_center
.
This query uses the
WITH
clause
to define subqueries. The query also uses the
ST_DISTANCE
and
ST_GEOGPOINT
geospatial analytics functions. For more information about these functions, see
Geography
functions
. For more
information about geospatial analytics, see
Introduction to
geospatial analytics
.
