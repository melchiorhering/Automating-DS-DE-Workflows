</pre><p>In addition to creating the model, running a query that contains the <code>CREATE MODEL</code>statement trains the model using the data retrieved by your query's <code>SELECT</code>statement.</p><strong>Query details</strong><p>The <code>CREATE MODEL</code>clause is used to create and train the model named <code>bqml_tutorial.sample_model</code>.</p><p>The <code>OPTIONS(model_type='logistic_reg')</code>clause indicates that you are creating
a <a>logistic regression</a>model.
A logistic regression model tries to split input data into two classes and gives
the probability the data is in one of the classes. Usually, what you are
trying to detect (such as whether an email is spam) is represented by 1 and
everything else is represented by 0.

BigQuery by using SQL queries and Python code. The goal is to democratize machine
learning by enabling SQL practitioners to build models using their existing
tools and to increase development speed by eliminating the need for data
movement.</p><p>In this tutorial, you use the sample
<a>Google Analytics sample dataset for BigQuery</a>to create a model that predicts whether a website visitor will make a
transaction. For information on the schema of the Analytics dataset, see
<a>BigQuery export schema</a>in the Analytics Help Center.</p><h2>Objectives</h2><p>In this tutorial, you use:</p><ul><li>BigQuery ML to create a binary logistic regression model using the
<code>CREATE MODEL</code>statement</li><li>The <code>ML.EVALUATE</code>function to evaluate the ML model</li><li>The <code>ML.PREDICT</code>function to make predictions using the ML model</li></ul><h2>Costs</h2><p>This tutorial uses billable components of Google Cloud,
including the following:</p><ul><li>BigQuery</li><li>BigQuery ML</li></ul><p>For more information on BigQuery costs, see the
<a>BigQuery pricing</a>page.</p><p>For more information on BigQuery ML costs, see
