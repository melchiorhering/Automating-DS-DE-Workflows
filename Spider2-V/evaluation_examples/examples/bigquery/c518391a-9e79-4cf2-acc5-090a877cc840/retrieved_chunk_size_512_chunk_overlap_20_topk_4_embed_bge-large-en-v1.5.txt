BigQuery is automatically enabled in new projects.
  To activate BigQuery in a pre-existing project, go to

Create your dataset
Create a BigQuery dataset to store your ML model:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.
Go to the BigQuery page
In the
Explorer
pane, click your project name.
Click
more_vert
View actions > Create dataset
.
On the
Create dataset
page, do the following:
For
Dataset ID
, enter
bqml_tutorial
.
For
Location type
, select
Multi-region
, and then select
US (multiple regions in United States)
.
The public datasets are stored in the
US
multi-region
. For simplicity,
store your dataset in the same location.
Leave the remaining default settings as they are, and click
Create dataset
.
Create your model
Next, you create a logistic regression model using the Analytics sample
dataset for BigQuery.
SQL
The following GoogleSQL query is used to
create the model you use to predict whether a website visitor will make a
transaction.

BigQuery DataFrames
Before trying this sample, follow the BigQuery DataFrames
    setup instructions in the
BigQuery quickstart
    using BigQuery DataFrames
.
    For more information, see the
BigQuery DataFrames reference documentation
.
To authenticate to BigQuery, set up Application Default Credentials.

from bigframes.ml.linear_model import LogisticRegression
import bigframes.pandas as bpd

# Start by selecting the data you'll use for training. `read_gbq` accepts
# either a SQL query or a table ID. Since this example selects from multiple
# tables via a wildcard, use SQL to define this data. Watch issue
# https://github.com/googleapis/python-bigquery-dataframes/issues/169
# for updates to `read_gbq` to support wildcard tables.

df = bpd.read_gbq_table(
    "bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*",
    filters=[
        ("_table_suffix", ">=", "20160801"),
        ("_table_suffix", "<=", "20170630"),
    ],
)

# Extract the total number of transactions within
# the Google Analytics session.
#
# Because the totals column is a STRUCT data type, call
# Series.struct.field("transactions") to extract the transactions field.
# See the reference documentation below:
# https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/bigframes/latest/bigframes.operations.structs.StructAccessor#bigframes_operations_structs_StructAccessor_field
transactions = df["totals"].struct.field("transactions")

# The "label" values represent the outcome of the model's
# prediction. In this case, the model predicts if there are any
# ecommerce transactions within the Google Analytics session.
# If the number of transactions is NULL, the value in the label
# column is set to 0. Otherwise, it is set to 1.
label = transactions.notnull().map({True: 1, False: 0}).rename("label")

# Extract the operating system of the visitor's device.

#standardSQL
CREATE MODEL `bqml_tutorial.sample_model`
OPTIONS(model_type='logistic_reg') AS
SELECT
IF(totals.transactions IS NULL, 0, 1) AS label,
IFNULL(device.operatingSystem, "") AS os,
device.isMobile AS is_mobile,
IFNULL(geoNetwork.country, "") AS country,
IFNULL(totals.pageviews, 0) AS pageviews
FROM
`bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`
WHERE
_TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20160801' AND '20170630'
In addition to creating the model, running a query that contains the
CREATE MODEL
statement trains the model using the data retrieved by your query's
SELECT
statement.
Query details
The
CREATE MODEL
clause is used to create and train the model named
bqml_tutorial.sample_model
.
The
OPTIONS(model_type='logistic_reg')
clause indicates that you are creating
a
logistic regression
model.
A logistic regression model tries to split input data into two classes and gives
the probability the data is in one of the classes. Usually, what you are
trying to detect (such as whether an email is spam) is represented by 1 and
everything else is represented by 0. If the logistic regression model outputs
0.9, there is a 90% probability the input is what you are trying to detect
(the email is spam).
This query's
SELECT
statement retrieves the following columns that are used by
the model to predict the probability a customer will complete a transaction:
totals.transactions
— The total number of ecommerce transactions
within the session. If the number of transactions is
NULL
, the value in the
label
column is set to
0
. Otherwise, it is set to
1
. These values
represent the possible outcomes. Creating an alias named
label
is an
alternative to setting the
input_label_cols=
option in the
CREATE MODEL
statement.
device.operatingSystem
— The operating system of the visitor's device.
device.isMobile
— Indicates whether the visitor's device is a mobile
device.
geoNetwork.country
— The country from which the sessions originated,
based on the IP address.
