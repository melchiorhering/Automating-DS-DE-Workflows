Caution
: Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted.
If you used an existing project for
      the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
      done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
      the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an
appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
    can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
Manage resources
page.
Go to Manage resources
In the project list, select the project that you
    want to delete, and then click
Delete
