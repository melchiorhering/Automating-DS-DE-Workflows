container images and will load up some examples. Once all containers
are downloaded and the output settles, you're ready to log in.</p><h3>3.

Superset is now up and running on your machine! ðŸŽ‰<a>â€‹</a></h4><h3>Wrapping Up<a>â€‹</a></h3><p>Once you're done with Superset, you can stop and delete just like any other container environment:</p><span><span>$ </span><span>docker</span><span>compose down</span></span><div><div>tip</div><p>You can use the same environment more than once, as Superset will persist data locally. However, make sure to properly stop all
processes by running Docker Compose <code>stop</code>command.

)<a>â€‹</a></h2><p>Setting things up to squeeze an "hello world" into any part of Superset should be as simple as</p><span><span>docker-compose</span><span>up</span></span><p>Note that:</p><ul><li>this will pull/build docker images and run a cluster of services, including:<ul><li>A Superset <strong>Flask web server</strong>, mounting the local python repo/code</li><li>A Superset <strong>Celery worker</strong>, also mounting the local python repo/code</li><li>A Superset <strong>Node service</strong>, mounting, compiling and bundling the JS/TS assets</li><li>A Superset <strong>Node websocket service</strong>to power the async backend</li><li><strong>Postgres</strong>as the metadata database and to store example datasets, charts and dashboards whic
should be populated upon startup</li><li><strong>Redis</strong>as the message queue for our async backend and caching backend</li></ul></li><li>It'll load up examples into the database upon first startup</li><li>all other details and pointers available in
<a>docker-compose.yml</a></li><li>The local repository is mounted withing the services, meaning updating
the code on the host will be reflected in the docker images</li><li>Superset is served at localhost:8088/</li><li>You can login with admin/admin</li></ul><div><div>caution</div><p>Since <code>docker-compose</code>is primarily designed to run a set of containers on <strong>a single host</strong>and can't credibly support <strong>high availability</strong>as a result, we do not support nor recommend
using our <code>docker-compose</code>constructs to support production-type use-cases. For single host
environments, we recommend using <a>minikube</a>along
our <a>installing on k8s</a>documentation.

Note that many browsers now default to <code>https</code>- if
yours is one of them, please make sure it uses <code>http</code>.</p><p>Log in with the default username and password:</p><span>username: admin</span><span>password: admin</span><h2>4. Connecting Superset to your local database instance<a>â€‹</a></h2><p>When running Superset using <code>docker</code>or <code>docker compose</code>it runs in its own docker container, as if
the Superset was running in a separate machine entirely. Therefore attempts to connect to your local
database with the hostname <code>localhost</code>won't work as <code>localhost</code>refers to the docker container
Superset is running in, and not your actual host machine. Fortunately, docker provides an easy way
to access network resources in the host machine from inside a container, and we will leverage this
capability to connect to our local database instance.</p><p>Here the instructions are for connecting to postgresql (which is running on your host machine) from
Superset (which is running in its docker container). Other databases may have slightly different
configurations but gist would be same and boils down to 2 steps -</p><li><strong>(Mac users may skip this step)</strong>Configuring the local postgresql/database instance to accept
public incoming connections. By default, postgresql only allows incoming connections from
<code>localhost</code>and under Docker, unless you use <code>--network=host</code>, <code>localhost</code>will refer to different
endpoints on the host machine and in a docker container respectively. Allowing postgresql to accept
connections from the Docker involves making one-line changes to the files <code>postgresql.conf</code>and
<code>pg_hba.conf</code>; you can find helpful links tailored to your OS / PG version on the web easily for
this task.

Documentation Title:
Docker Compose | Superset

Documentation Content:
Here we'll refer generally
to <code>docker compose up</code>even though in some cases you may want to force a check for newer remote
images using <code>docker compose pull</code>, force a build with <code>docker compose build</code>or force a build
on latest base images using <code>docker compose build --pull</code>. In most cases though, the simple
<code>up</code>command should do just fine. Refer to docker compose docs for more information on the topic.</p><h3>Option #1 - for an interactive development environment<a>â€‹</a></h3><span><span>docker</span><span>compose up</span></span><div><div>tip</div><p>When running in development mode the <code>superset-node</code>container needs to finish building assets in order for the UI to render properly. If you would just
like to try out Superset without making any code changes follow the steps documented for
<code>production</code>or a specific version below.</p></div><div><div>tip</div><p>By default, we mount the local superset-frontend folder here and run <code>npm install</code>as well
as <code>npm run dev</code>which triggers webpack to compile/bundle the frontend code. Depending
on your local setup, especially if you have less than 16GB of memory,  it may be very slow to
perform those operations. In this case, we recommend you set the env var
<code>BUILD_SUPERSET_FRONTEND_IN_DOCKER</code>to <code>false</code>, and to run this locally instead in a terminal.
