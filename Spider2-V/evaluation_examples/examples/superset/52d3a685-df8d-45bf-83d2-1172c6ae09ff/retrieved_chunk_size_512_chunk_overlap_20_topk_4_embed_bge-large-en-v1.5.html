The following section
explains how to enable this functionality for the examples database.</p><p>In the top menu, select <strong>Data ‣ Databases</strong>. Find the <strong>examples</strong>database in the list and
select the <strong>Edit</strong>button.</p><p>In the resulting modal window, switch to the <strong>Extra</strong>tab and
tick the checkbox for <strong>Allow Data Upload</strong>. End by clicking the <strong>Save</strong>button.</p><h3>Loading CSV Data<a>​</a></h3><p>Download the CSV dataset to your computer from
<a>GitHub</a>.
In the Superset menu, select <strong>Data ‣ Upload a CSV</strong>.</p><p>Then, enter the <strong>Table Name</strong>as <em>tutorial_flights</em>and select the CSV file from your computer.</p><p>Next enter the text <em>Travel Date</em>into the <strong>Parse Dates</strong>field.</p><p>Leaving all the other options in their default settings, select <strong>Save</strong>at the bottom of the page.</p><h3>Table Visualization<a>​</a></h3><p>You should now see <em>tutorial_flights</em>as a dataset in the <strong>Datasets</strong>tab. Click on the entry to
launch an Explore workflow using this dataset.</p><p>In this section, we'll create a table visualization
to show the number of flights and cost per travel class.</p><p>By default, Apache Superset only shows the last week of data. In our example, we want to visualize all
of the data in the dataset. Click the <strong>Time ‣ Time Range</strong>section and change
the <strong>Range Type</strong>to <strong>No Filter</strong>.</p><p>Click <strong>Apply</strong>to save.</p><p>Now, we want to specify the rows in our table by using the <strong>Group by</strong>option.

By the
end of this section, you will have created a table that shows the monthly spend on flights for the
first six months, by department, by travel class.</p><p>Create a new chart by selecting <strong>+ ‣ Chart</strong>from the top right corner. Choose
tutorial_flights again as a datasource, then click on the visualization type to get to the
visualization menu. Select the <strong>Pivot Table</strong>visualization (you can filter by entering text in the
search box) and then <strong>Create New Chart</strong>.</p><p>In the <strong>Time</strong>section, keep the Time Column as Travel Date (this is selected automatically as we
only have one time column in our dataset). Then select Time Grain to be month as having daily data
would be too granular to see patterns from. Then select the time range to be the first six months of
2011 by click on Last week in the Time Range section, then in Custom selecting a Start / end of 1st
January 2011 and 30th June 2011 respectively by either entering directly the dates or using the
calendar widget (by selecting the month name and then the year, you can move more quickly to far
away dates).</p><p>Next, within the <strong>Query</strong>section, remove the default COUNT(*) and add Cost, keeping the default
SUM aggregate. Note that Apache Superset will indicate the type of the metric by the symbol on the
left hand column of the list (ABC for string, # for number, a clock face for time, etc.).</p><p>In <strong>Group by</strong>select <strong>Time</strong>: this will automatically use the Time Column and Time Grain
selections we defined in the Time section.</p><p>Within <strong>Columns</strong>, select first Department and then Travel Class. All set – let’s <strong>Run Query</strong>to
see some data!</p><p>You should see months in the rows and Department and Travel Class in the columns.

Since in this
example, we want to understand different Travel Classes, we select <strong>Travel Class</strong>in this menu.</p><p>Next, we can specify the metrics we would like to see in our table with the <strong>Metrics</strong>option.</p><ul><li><code>COUNT(*)</code>, which represents the number of rows in the table
(in this case, quantity of flights in each Travel Class)</li><li><code>SUM(Cost)</code>, which represents the total cost spent by each Travel Class</li></ul><p>Finally, select <strong>Run Query</strong>to see the results of the table.</p><p>To save the visualization, click on <strong>Save</strong>in the top left of the screen. In the following modal,</p><ul><li>Select the <strong>Save as</strong>option and enter the chart name as Tutorial Table (you will be able to find it again through the
<strong>Charts</strong>screen, accessible in the top menu).</li><li>Select <strong>Add To Dashboard</strong>and enter
Tutorial Dashboard. Finally, select <strong>Save &amp; Go To Dashboard</strong>.</li></ul><h3>Dashboard Basics<a>​</a></h3><p>Next, we are going to explore the dashboard interface. If you’ve followed the previous section, you
should already have the dashboard open. Otherwise, you can navigate to the dashboard by selecting
Dashboards on the top menu, then Tutorial dashboard from the list of dashboards.</p><p>On this dashboard you should see the table you created in the previous section. Select <strong>Edit
dashboard</strong>and then hover over the table. By selecting the bottom right hand corner of the table
(the cursor will change too), you can resize it by dragging and dropping.</p><p>Finally, save your changes by selecting Save changes in the top right.</p><h3>Pivot Table<a>​</a></h3><p>In this section, we will extend our analysis using a more complex visualization, Pivot Table.

If the connection looks good, save the configuration
by clicking the <strong>Connect</strong>button in the bottom right corner of the modal window:</p><p>Congratulations, you've just added a new data source in Superset!</p><h3>Registering a new table<a>​</a></h3><p>Now that you’ve configured a data source, you can select specific tables (called <strong>Datasets</strong>in Superset)
that you want exposed in Superset for querying.</p><p>Navigate to <strong>Data ‣ Datasets</strong>and select the <strong>+ Dataset</strong>button in the top right corner.</p><p>A modal window should pop up in front of you. Select your <strong>Database</strong>,
<strong>Schema</strong>, and <strong>Table</strong>using the drop downs that appear. In the following example,
we register the <strong>cleaned_sales_data</strong>table from the <strong>examples</strong>database.</p><p>To finish, click the <strong>Add</strong>button in the bottom right corner. You should now see your dataset in the list of datasets.</p><h3>Customizing column properties<a>​</a></h3><p>Now that you've registered your dataset, you can configure column properties
for how the column should be treated in the Explore workflow:</p><ul><li>Is the column temporal? (should it be used for slicing &amp; dicing in time series charts?)</li><li>Should the column be filterable?</li><li>Is the column dimensional?</li><li>If it's a datetime column, how should Superset parse
the datetime format? (using the <a>ISO-8601 string pattern</a>)</li></ul><h3>Superset semantic layer<a>​</a></h3><p>Superset has a thin semantic layer that adds many quality of life improvements for analysts.
The Superset semantic layer can store 2 types of computed data:</p><li>Virtual metrics: you can write SQL queries that aggregate values
from multiple column (e.g.
