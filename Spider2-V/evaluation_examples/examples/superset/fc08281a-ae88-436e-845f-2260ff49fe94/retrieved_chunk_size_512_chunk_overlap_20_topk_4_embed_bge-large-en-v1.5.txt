Creating charts in Explore view
​
Superset has 2 main interfaces for exploring data:
Explore
: no-code viz builder. Select your dataset, select the chart,
customize the appearance, and publish.
SQL Lab
: SQL IDE for cleaning, joining, and preparing data for Explore workflow
We'll focus on the Explore view for creating charts right now.
To start the Explore workflow from the
Datasets
tab, start by clicking the name
of the dataset that will be powering your chart.
You're now presented with a powerful workflow for exploring data and iterating on charts.
The
Dataset
view on the left-hand side has a list of columns and metrics,
scoped to the current dataset you selected.
The
Data
preview below the chart area also gives you helpful data context.
Using the
Data
tab and
Customize
tabs, you can change the visualization type,
select the temporal column, select the metric to group by, and customize
the aesthetics of the chart.
As you customize your chart using drop-down menus, make sure to click the
Run
button
to get visual feedback.
In the following screenshot, we craft a grouped Time-series Bar Chart to visualize
our quarterly sales data by product line just by clicking options in drop-down menus.
Creating a slice and dashboard
​
To save your chart, first click the
Save
button. You can either:
Save your chart and add it to an existing dashboard
Save your chart and add it to a new dashboard
In the following screenshot, we save the chart to a new "Superset Duper Sales Dashboard":
To publish, click
Save and goto Dashboard
.
Behind the scenes, Superset will create a slice and store all the information needed
to create your chart in its thin data layer
(the query, chart type, options selected, name, etc).
To resize the chart, start by clicking the Edit Dashboard button in the top right corner.
Then, click and drag the bottom right corner of the chart until the chart layout snaps
into a position you like onto the underlying grid.
Click
Save
to persist the changes.
Congrats! You’ve successfully linked, analyzed, and visualized data in Superset.

Within Metrics, remove the default
COUNT(*)
metric and instead add
AVG(Cost)
, to show the mean value.
Next, select
Run Query
to show the data on the chart.
How does this look? Well, we can see that the average cost goes up in December. However, perhaps it
doesn’t make sense to combine both single and return tickets, but rather show two separate lines for
each ticket type.
Let’s do this by selecting Ticket Single or Return in the Group by box, and the selecting
Run
Query
again. Nice! We can see that on average single tickets are cheaper than returns and that the
big spike in December is caused by return tickets.
Our chart is looking pretty good already, but let’s customize some more by going to the Customize
tab on the left hand pane. Within this pane, try changing the Color Scheme, removing the range
filter by selecting No in the Show Range Filter drop down and adding some labels using X Axis Label
and Y Axis Label.
Once you’re done, publish the chart in your Tutorial Dashboard.
Markup
​
In this section, we will add some text to our dashboard. If you’re there already, you can navigate
to the dashboard by selecting Dashboards on the top menu, then Tutorial dashboard from the list of
dashboards. Got into edit mode by selecting
Edit dashboard
.
Within the Insert components pane, drag and drop a Markdown box on the dashboard. Look for the blue
lines which indicate the anchor where the box will go.
Now, to edit the text, select the box. You can enter text, in markdown format (see
this Markdown Cheatsheet
for
more information about this format). You can toggle between Edit and Preview using the menu on the
top of the box.
To exit, select any other part of the dashboard. Finally, don’t forget to keep your changes using
Save changes
.
Publishing Your Dashboard
​
If you have followed all of the steps outlined in the previous section, you should have a dashboard
that looks like the below. If you would like, you can rearrange the elements of the dashboard by
selecting
Edit dashboard
and dragging and dropping.

Documentation Content:
Next, in the Time Comparison subsection of
Advanced Analytics
, enter the Time Shift by typing in
“minus 1 week” (note this box accepts input in natural language). Run Query to see the new chart,
which has an additional series with the same values, shifted a week back in time.
Then, change the
Calculation type
to Absolute difference and select
Run Query
. We can now
see only one series again, this time showing the difference between the two series we saw
previously.
Save the chart as Tutorial Time Comparison and add it to the Tutorial Dashboard.
Resampling the data
​
In this section, we’ll resample the data so that rather than having daily data we have weekly data.
As in the previous section, reopen the Tutorial Advanced Analytics Base chart.
Next, in the Python Functions subsection of
Advanced Analytics
, enter 7D, corresponding to seven
days, in the Rule and median as the Method and show the chart by selecting
Run Query
.
Note that now we have a single data point every 7 days. In our case, the value showed corresponds to
the median value within the seven daily data points. For more information on the meaning of the
various options in this section, refer to the
Pandas documentation
.
Lastly, save your chart as Tutorial Resample and add it to the Tutorial Dashboard. Go to the
tutorial dashboard to see the four charts side by side and compare the different outputs.
