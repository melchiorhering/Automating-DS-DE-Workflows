Publish this chart
to your existing Tutorial Dashboard you created earlier.</p><h3>Line Chart<a>​</a></h3><p>In this section, we are going to create a line chart to understand the average price of a ticket by
month across the entire dataset.</p><p>In the Time section, as before, keep the Time Column as Travel Date and Time Grain as month but this
time for the Time range select No filter as we want to look at entire dataset.</p><p>Within Metrics, remove the default <code>COUNT(*)</code>metric and instead add <code>AVG(Cost)</code>, to show the mean value.</p><p>Next, select <strong>Run Query</strong>to show the data on the chart.</p><p>How does this look? Well, we can see that the average cost goes up in December. However, perhaps it
doesn’t make sense to combine both single and return tickets, but rather show two separate lines for
each ticket type.</p><p>Let’s do this by selecting Ticket Single or Return in the Group by box, and the selecting <strong>Run
Query</strong>again. Nice! We can see that on average single tickets are cheaper than returns and that the
big spike in December is caused by return tickets.</p><p>Our chart is looking pretty good already, but let’s customize some more by going to the Customize
tab on the left hand pane. Within this pane, try changing the Color Scheme, removing the range
filter by selecting No in the Show Range Filter drop down and adding some labels using X Axis Label
and Y Axis Label.</p><p>Once you’re done, publish the chart in your Tutorial Dashboard.</p><h3>Markup<a>​</a></h3><p>In this section, we will add some text to our dashboard. If you’re there already, you can navigate
to the dashboard by selecting Dashboards on the top menu, then Tutorial dashboard from the list of
dashboards. Got into edit mode by selecting <strong>Edit dashboard</strong>.</p><p>Within the Insert components pane, drag and drop a Markdown box on the dashboard.

To start the Explore workflow from the <strong>Datasets</strong>tab, start by clicking the name
of the dataset that will be powering your chart.</p><p>You're now presented with a powerful workflow for exploring data and iterating on charts.</p><ul><li>The <strong>Dataset</strong>view on the left-hand side has a list of columns and metrics,
scoped to the current dataset you selected.</li><li>The <strong>Data</strong>preview below the chart area also gives you helpful data context.</li><li>Using the <strong>Data</strong>tab and <strong>Customize</strong>tabs, you can change the visualization type,
select the temporal column, select the metric to group by, and customize
the aesthetics of the chart.</li></ul><p>As you customize your chart using drop-down menus, make sure to click the <strong>Run</strong>button
to get visual feedback.</p><p>In the following screenshot, we craft a grouped Time-series Bar Chart to visualize
our quarterly sales data by product line just by clicking options in drop-down menus.</p><h3>Creating a slice and dashboard<a>​</a></h3><p>To save your chart, first click the <strong>Save</strong>button. You can either:</p><ul><li>Save your chart and add it to an existing dashboard</li><li>Save your chart and add it to a new dashboard</li></ul><p>In the following screenshot, we save the chart to a new "Superset Duper Sales Dashboard":</p><p>To publish, click <strong>Save and goto Dashboard</strong>.</p><p>Behind the scenes, Superset will create a slice and store all the information needed
to create your chart in its thin data layer
(the query, chart type, options selected, name, etc).</p><p>To resize the chart, start by clicking the Edit Dashboard button in the top right corner.</p><p>Then, click and drag the bottom right corner of the chart until the chart layout snaps
into a position you like onto the underlying grid.</p><p>Click <strong>Save</strong>to persist the changes.</p><p>Congrats!

Run Query to see the new chart,
which has an additional series with the same values, shifted a week back in time.</p><p>Then, change the <strong>Calculation type</strong>to Absolute difference and select <strong>Run Query</strong>. We can now
see only one series again, this time showing the difference between the two series we saw
previously.</p><p>Save the chart as Tutorial Time Comparison and add it to the Tutorial Dashboard.</p><h3>Resampling the data<a>​</a></h3><p>In this section, we’ll resample the data so that rather than having daily data we have weekly data.
As in the previous section, reopen the Tutorial Advanced Analytics Base chart.</p><p>Next, in the Python Functions subsection of <strong>Advanced Analytics</strong>, enter 7D, corresponding to seven
days, in the Rule and median as the Method and show the chart by selecting <strong>Run Query</strong>.</p><p>Note that now we have a single data point every 7 days. In our case, the value showed corresponds to
the median value within the seven daily data points. For more information on the meaning of the
various options in this section, refer to the
<a>Pandas documentation</a>.</p><p>Lastly, save your chart as Tutorial Resample and add it to the Tutorial Dashboard.

Then, select the Volcanic Eruptions layer, add a short description

appear automatically in the Tutorial Dashboard.</p><h3>Advanced Analytics<a>​</a></h3><p>In this section, we are going to explore the Advanced Analytics feature of Apache Superset that
allows you to apply additional transformations to your data. The three types of transformation are:</p><strong>Setting up the base chart</strong><p>In this section, we’re going to set up a base chart which we can then apply the different <strong>Advanced
Analytics</strong>features to. Start off by creating a new chart using the same <em>tutorial_flights</em>datasource and the <strong>Line Chart</strong>visualization type. Within the Time section, set the Time Range as
1st October 2011 and 31st October 2011.</p><p>Next, in the query section, change the Metrics to the sum of Cost. Select <strong>Run Query</strong>to show the
chart.
