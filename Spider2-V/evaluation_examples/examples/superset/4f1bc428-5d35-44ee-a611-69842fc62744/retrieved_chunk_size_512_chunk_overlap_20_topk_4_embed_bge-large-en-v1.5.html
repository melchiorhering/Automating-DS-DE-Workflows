To start the Explore workflow from the <strong>Datasets</strong>tab, start by clicking the name
of the dataset that will be powering your chart.</p><p>You're now presented with a powerful workflow for exploring data and iterating on charts.</p><ul><li>The <strong>Dataset</strong>view on the left-hand side has a list of columns and metrics,
scoped to the current dataset you selected.</li><li>The <strong>Data</strong>preview below the chart area also gives you helpful data context.</li><li>Using the <strong>Data</strong>tab and <strong>Customize</strong>tabs, you can change the visualization type,
select the temporal column, select the metric to group by, and customize
the aesthetics of the chart.</li></ul><p>As you customize your chart using drop-down menus, make sure to click the <strong>Run</strong>button
to get visual feedback.</p><p>In the following screenshot, we craft a grouped Time-series Bar Chart to visualize
our quarterly sales data by product line just by clicking options in drop-down menus.</p><h3>Creating a slice and dashboard<a>​</a></h3><p>To save your chart, first click the <strong>Save</strong>button. You can either:</p><ul><li>Save your chart and add it to an existing dashboard</li><li>Save your chart and add it to a new dashboard</li></ul><p>In the following screenshot, we save the chart to a new "Superset Duper Sales Dashboard":</p><p>To publish, click <strong>Save and goto Dashboard</strong>.</p><p>Behind the scenes, Superset will create a slice and store all the information needed
to create your chart in its thin data layer
(the query, chart type, options selected, name, etc).</p><p>To resize the chart, start by clicking the Edit Dashboard button in the top right corner.</p><p>Then, click and drag the bottom right corner of the chart until the chart layout snaps
into a position you like onto the underlying grid.</p><p>Click <strong>Save</strong>to persist the changes.</p><p>Congrats!

Since in this
example, we want to understand different Travel Classes, we select <strong>Travel Class</strong>in this menu.</p><p>Next, we can specify the metrics we would like to see in our table with the <strong>Metrics</strong>option.</p><ul><li><code>COUNT(*)</code>, which represents the number of rows in the table
(in this case, quantity of flights in each Travel Class)</li><li><code>SUM(Cost)</code>, which represents the total cost spent by each Travel Class</li></ul><p>Finally, select <strong>Run Query</strong>to see the results of the table.</p><p>To save the visualization, click on <strong>Save</strong>in the top left of the screen. In the following modal,</p><ul><li>Select the <strong>Save as</strong>option and enter the chart name as Tutorial Table (you will be able to find it again through the
<strong>Charts</strong>screen, accessible in the top menu).</li><li>Select <strong>Add To Dashboard</strong>and enter
Tutorial Dashboard. Finally, select <strong>Save &amp; Go To Dashboard</strong>.</li></ul><h3>Dashboard Basics<a>​</a></h3><p>Next, we are going to explore the dashboard interface. If you’ve followed the previous section, you
should already have the dashboard open. Otherwise, you can navigate to the dashboard by selecting
Dashboards on the top menu, then Tutorial dashboard from the list of dashboards.</p><p>On this dashboard you should see the table you created in the previous section. Select <strong>Edit
dashboard</strong>and then hover over the table. By selecting the bottom right hand corner of the table
(the cursor will change too), you can resize it by dragging and dropping.</p><p>Finally, save your changes by selecting Save changes in the top right.</p><h3>Pivot Table<a>​</a></h3><p>In this section, we will extend our analysis using a more complex visualization, Pivot Table.

You’ve successfully linked, analyzed, and visualized data in Superset. There are a wealth
of other table configuration and visualization options, so please start exploring and creating
slices and dashboards of your own</p><p>ֿ</p><h3>Manage access to Dashboards<a>​</a></h3><p>Access to dashboards is managed via owners (users that have edit permissions to the dashboard)</p><p>Non-owner users access can be managed two different ways:</p><ol><li>Dataset permissions - if you add to the relevant role permissions to datasets it automatically grants implicit access to all dashboards that uses those permitted datasets</li><li>Dashboard roles - if you enable <strong>DASHBOARD_RBAC</strong><a>feature flag</a>then you be able to manage which roles can access the dashboard<ul><li>Granting a role access to a dashboard will bypass dataset level checks. Having dashboard access implicitly grants read access to all the featured charts in the dashboard, and thereby also all the associated datasets.</li><li>If no roles are specified for a dashboard, regular <strong>Dataset permissions</strong>will apply.
