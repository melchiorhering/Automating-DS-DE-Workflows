If the connection looks good, save the configuration
by clicking the <strong>Connect</strong>button in the bottom right corner of the modal window:</p><p>Congratulations, you've just added a new data source in Superset!</p><h3>Registering a new table<a>​</a></h3><p>Now that you’ve configured a data source, you can select specific tables (called <strong>Datasets</strong>in Superset)
that you want exposed in Superset for querying.</p><p>Navigate to <strong>Data ‣ Datasets</strong>and select the <strong>+ Dataset</strong>button in the top right corner.</p><p>A modal window should pop up in front of you. Select your <strong>Database</strong>,
<strong>Schema</strong>, and <strong>Table</strong>using the drop downs that appear. In the following example,
we register the <strong>cleaned_sales_data</strong>table from the <strong>examples</strong>database.</p><p>To finish, click the <strong>Add</strong>button in the bottom right corner. You should now see your dataset in the list of datasets.</p><h3>Customizing column properties<a>​</a></h3><p>Now that you've registered your dataset, you can configure column properties
for how the column should be treated in the Explore workflow:</p><ul><li>Is the column temporal? (should it be used for slicing &amp; dicing in time series charts?)</li><li>Should the column be filterable?</li><li>Is the column dimensional?</li><li>If it's a datetime column, how should Superset parse
the datetime format? (using the <a>ISO-8601 string pattern</a>)</li></ul><h3>Superset semantic layer<a>​</a></h3><p>Superset has a thin semantic layer that adds many quality of life improvements for analysts.
The Superset semantic layer can store 2 types of computed data:</p><li>Virtual metrics: you can write SQL queries that aggregate values
from multiple column (e.g.

Then, select the Volcanic Eruptions layer, add a short description
Grímsvötn and the eruption dates (23-25 May 2011) before finally saving.</p><p>Then, navigate to the line chart by going to Charts then selecting Tutorial Line Chart from the
list. Next, go to the Annotations and Layers section and select Add Annotation Layer. Within this
dialogue:</p><ul><li>Name the layer as Volcanic Eruptions</li><li>Change the Annotation Layer Type to Event</li><li>Set the Annotation Source as Superset annotation</li><li>Specify the Annotation Layer as Volcanic Eruptions</li></ul><p>Select <strong>Apply</strong>to see your annotation shown on the chart.</p><p>If you wish, you can change how your annotation looks by changing the settings in the Display
configuration section. Otherwise, select <strong>OK</strong>and finally <strong>Save</strong>to save your chart. If you keep

appear automatically in the Tutorial Dashboard.</p><h3>Advanced Analytics<a>​</a></h3><p>In this section, we are going to explore the Advanced Analytics feature of Apache Superset that
allows you to apply additional transformations to your data. The three types of transformation are:</p><strong>Setting up the base chart</strong><p>In this section, we’re going to set up a base chart which we can then apply the different <strong>Advanced
Analytics</strong>features to. Start off by creating a new chart using the same <em>tutorial_flights</em>datasource and the <strong>Line Chart</strong>visualization type. Within the Time section, set the Time Range as
1st October 2011 and 31st October 2011.</p><p>Next, in the query section, change the Metrics to the sum of Cost. Select <strong>Run Query</strong>to show the
chart.

<a>GitHub</a>.
In the Superset menu, select <strong>Data ‣ Upload a CSV</strong>.</p><p>Then, enter the <strong>Table Name</strong>as <em>tutorial_flights</em>and select the CSV file from your computer.</p><p>Next enter the text <em>Travel Date</em>into the <strong>Parse Dates</strong>field.</p><p>Leaving all the other options in their default settings, select <strong>Save</strong>at the bottom of the page.</p><h3>Table Visualization<a>​</a></h3><p>You should now see <em>tutorial_flights</em>as a dataset in the <strong>Datasets</strong>tab. Click on the entry to
launch an Explore workflow using this dataset.</p><p>In this section, we'll create a table visualization
to show the number of flights and cost per travel class.</p><p>By default, Apache Superset only shows the last week of data. In our example, we want to visualize all
of the data in the dataset. Click the <strong>Time ‣ Time Range</strong>section and change
the <strong>Range Type</strong>to <strong>No Filter</strong>.</p><p>Click <strong>Apply</strong>to save.</p><p>Now, we want to specify the rows in our table by using the <strong>Group by</strong>option.

dates when some flights were cancelled by the UK’s Civil Aviation Authority in response to the
eruption of the Grímsvötn volcano in Iceland (23-25 May 2011).</p><p>First, add an annotation layer by navigating to Manage ‣ Annotation Layers. Add a new annotation
layer by selecting the green plus sign to add a new record. Enter the name Volcanic Eruptions and
save. We can use this layer to refer to a number of different annotations.</p><p>Next, add an annotation by navigating to Manage ‣ Annotations and then create a new annotation by
