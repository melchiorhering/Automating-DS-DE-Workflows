To do this:\n1. Find and locate the funnel icon at the top part (the middle one of 3 icons on the left of text \"Hardware View: ITAM Workspace\"). Click it.\n2. Find the input box \"-- choose field --\", click it.\n3. In the drop-down menu, type the keyword \"Serial\" into the input box to quickly filter the results. Click the entry \"Serial number\" in the filtered list.\n4. Next, we choose the operator for this option, click and choose \"is\" value\n5. And in the input box on the right, leave it empty\n6. Click the button \"AND\" on the right to add another condition.\n7. Again, we repeat the previous steps 2-5, to add another filter condition:\nChoose option: Model category\nChoose operator: is\nInput value: Computer\n8. Click the button \"AND\" again to add another condition:\nChoose option: Asset function\nChoose operator: is\nSelect value: Shared\n9. Click the button \"AND\" again to add the last condition:\nChoose option: Display name\nChoose operator: is\nInput value: Apple MacBook Pro 15\"\n10. Finally, click the button \"Run\" to filter the results. You may need to wait for a few seconds for the filter engine to work.\nTill now, we have completed this task.\nYou can exactly follow the detailed plan above or proactively tackle the task based on the real-time environment interaction by yourself.",
