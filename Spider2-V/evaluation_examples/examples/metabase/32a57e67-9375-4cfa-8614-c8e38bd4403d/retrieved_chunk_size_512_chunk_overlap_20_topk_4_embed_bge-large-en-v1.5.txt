API keys
Metabase can create API keys to authenticate programmatic requests to the API. To set the permissions for an API key, you can assign the key to a
group
.
Fair warning about Metabase’s API
We don’t version the
Metabase API
. We rarely change API endpoints, and almost never remove them, but if you write code that relies on the API, there’s a chance you might have to update your code in the future.
That said, there are times when it’s nice to work with the API, like when managing permissions with a large number of people and groups, or bulk archiving, or content creation. So we added the ability to create API keys to authenticate your programmatic requests.
Create an API key
To create an API key:
Click on the
gear
icon in the upper right.
Select
Admin settings
.
Go to the
Settings
tab.
Click on the
Authentication
tab on the left menu.
Scroll to
API Keys
and click
Manage
.
Click the
Create API Key
button.
Enter a
Key name
. You can have multiple API keys, so give it a name that will help you remember what you’re using the key for.
Select a
Group
. The key will have the same permissions granted to that group.
Click
Create
.
Copy the generated API key and save it somewhere safe. Metabase won’t be able to show you the key again. If you lose the key, you’ll need to regenerate a new key.
Managing API Keys
To view and manage existing API keys:
Click on the
gear
icon in the upper right.
Select
Admin settings
.
Go to the
Settings
tab.
Click on the
Authentication
tab on the left menu.

Documentation Content:
Go to the
Settings
tab.
Click on the
Authentication
tab on the left menu.
Scroll to
API Keys
and click
Manage
.
Editing API keys
To edit an API key, scroll to the key you want to edit and click on the
pencil
icon. Metabase will pop up an
Edit API Key
modal where you can edit:
The key’s name
Which group the key belongs to.
Change (regenerate) the key. Metabase will replace the existing API key with a new key. You won’t be able to recover the old key.
Deleting API keys
You won’t be able to recover a deleted API key. You’ll have to create a new key.
To delete an API Key:
Click on the
gear
icon in the upper right.
Select
Admin settings
.
Go to the
Settings
tab.
Click on the
Authentication
tab on the left menu.
Scroll to
API Keys
and click
Manage
.
Select the key you want to delete and click the
trash
icon.
Metabase will pop up a
Delete API Key
modal. Click the
Delete API Key
button.
Metabase will transfer API keys associated with a group that gets deleted to the All users group
If you have API keys assigned to a group, but then someone deletes that group, the API keys will still work, but Metabase will reassign those keys to the All users group. If you want to change their group, you’ll need to edit the keys manually.
Example
GET
requests
Here are some example
GET
requests that return the groups in your Metabase. These examples assume you’re running Metabase locally on the default port: 3000.
curl
example
Replace
YOUR_API_KEY
with the API key you generated above.
curl
\
-H
'x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY'
\
-X
GET
'http://localhost:3000/api/permissions/group'
JavaScript example
Assuming you’ve set your key as an environment variable like so:
export
METABASE_API_KEY
=
"YOUR_API_KEY"
Here’s a basic
GET
request using
fetch
to get the list of groups.

Documentation Title:
Working with the Metabase API

Documentation Content:
This makes it easy to have a pre-defined set of requests you want to make to the API.
curl
-H
@header_file.txt
-d
@payload.json http://localhost/api/card
Here’s the
header_file.text
in the above command:
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
Here’s an example of a JSON file (the
@payload.json
in the command above) that creates a question:
{
"visualization_settings"
:
{
"table.pivot_column"
:
"QUANTITY"
,
"table.cell_column"
:
"SUBTOTAL"
},
"description value"
:
"A card generated by the API"
,
"collection_position"
:
null
,
"result_metadata"
:
null
,
"metadata_checksum"
:
null
,
"collection_id"
:
null
,
"name"
:
"API-generated question"
,
"dataset_query"
:
{
"database"
:
1
,
"query"
:
{
"source-table"
:
2
},
"type"
:
"query"
},
"display"
:
"table"
}
That request generated the question:
Use developer tools to see how Metabase makes requests
If the auto-generated API docs are unclear, you can use the developer tools that ship with browsers like Firefox, Chrome, and Edge to view Metabase’s requests and responses.
In the Metabase application, perform the action that you’d like to script, such as adding a user or creating a dashboard. Then use the developer tools in your browser to view the request Metabase made to the server when you performed that action.
A few things you can do with the Metabase API
Provision a Metabase instance
In addition to using
environment variables
, you can use the Metabase API to setup an instance of Metabase. Once you have installed Metabase using your
preferred method
, and the Metabase server is up and running, you can create the first user (as an Admin) by posting to a special endpoint,
/api/setup
. This
/api/setup
endpoint:
Creates the first user as an Admin (superuser).
Logs them in.
Returns a session ID.
You can then configure settings using the
/api/settings
endpoint, set up email using the
/api/email
endpoint, and use the
/api/setup/admin_checklist
endpoint to verify your setup progress.
