Documentation Title:
Visualize your data as a histogram

Documentation Content:
The bins are of equal length (and can be empty), and the bins are contiguous. The height of each bar represents the count (or proportion) of the items in the bin. The number of bins is up to the user, though Metabase will automatically select the number of bins for you.
Here’s a bar chart that displays the count of people from the People table grouped by referral source.
Here’s the histogram we’ll create in
the walkthrough below
.
Metabase makes it easy to create a histogram. In fact, if the data is suitable for a histogram, Metabase will automatically create a histogram for you.
Create a histogram
Follow along with Metabase’s
Sample Database
to create the histogram detailed below.
Select
+ New
>
Question
. In the
Query Builder
under
Pick your starting data
, choose
Raw Data
>
Sample Database
, and select the
Orders
table. Then
Visualize
the results.
Once you’re viewing the Orders table, click
Summarize
. Scroll down and select
Total
, and click the
+
button to add the grouping. Metabase will automatically create a histogram for you!
The histogram shows that customers are most likely to make purchases totaling in the $40-60 range. If you hover over one of the bars, Metabase will display the count of orders in that range. You can also click on a bar to
drill-through the data
and see the orders that compose the bar.
Edit a histogram
Metabase gives you
a lot of knobs for customizing a bar chart
. For now, we’ll hone in on the settings that make histograms shine.
Metabase will automatically set the number of bins, but you can change how Metabase bins the data. Click
Summarize
, scroll down to
# Total
, and click on
Auto binned
. A dropdown menu will present the options:
Auto bin
, 10, 50, or 100 bins, or
Don't bin
.
Click the
Settings
>
Axes
. The x-axis scale currently says
Histogram
. Metabase detects when your
bar chart
should present as a histogram, and selects the best x-axis scale for your visualization.

We’ll walk through creating a
histogram
, which is a type of bar chart that displays groups of data across a continuous range. Histograms are helpful for gaining insights into how much of an item people are likely to buy, the price range they are likely to purchase within, or even the time of year that most people make purchases.
Histograms versus bar charts
Histograms are a type of
bar chart
. While the bars on a typical bar chart represent categorical groups, the bars on a histogram represent ranges along a continuous, quantifiable spectrum.
In other words, you split the data into bins in order to view the distribution of values within a range.
