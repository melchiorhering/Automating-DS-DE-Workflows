Documentation Title:
Running the Metabase JAR file

Documentation Content:
If you’re on a <a>Pro</a>or <a>Enterprise</a>plan, download the <a>JAR for the Enterprise Edition</a>.</li><li>Create a new directory and move the Metabase JAR into it.</li><li>Change into your new Metabase directory and run the JAR.</li></ol><code>java -jar metabase.jar
</code><p>Metabase will log its progress in the terminal as it starts up. Wait until you see “Metabase Initialization Complete” and visit <code>http://localhost:3000/setup</code>.</p><p>If you are using a paid version, be sure to <a>activate your license</a>.</p><h2>Local installation</h2><p>If you just want to try Metabase out, play around with Metabase, or just use Metabase on your local machine, Metabase ships with a default application database that you can use. <strong>This setup is not meant for production</strong>. If you intend to run Metabase for real at your organization, see <a>Production installation</a>.</p><p>The below instructions are the same as the quick start above, just with a little more context around each step.</p><h3>1. Install Java JRE</h3><p>You may already have Java installed. To check the version, open a terminal and run:</p><code>java -version
</code><p>If Java isn’t installed, you’ll need to install Java before you can run Metabase. We recommend version 11 of JRE from <a>Eclipse Temurin</a>with HotSpot JVM. You can run Metabase wherever Java 11 runs. The particular processor architecture shouldn’t matter (although we only test Metabase for x86 and ARM).</p><h3>2.

Documentation Title:
Metabase at scale

Documentation Content:
We use Elastic Beanstalk to host our internal Metabase application.</li><li>Docker: See <a>running Metabase on Docker</a>.</li></ul><p><a>Google Cloud Platform</a>, <a>Microsoft Azure</a>, <a>Digital Ocean</a>, and other cloud providers offer other great alternatives for hosting your Metabase application.</p><h2>Hosted Metabase</h2><p>If you don’t want to deal with the care and feeding of a Metabase application, Metabase offers a <a>hosted solution</a>. You still have to ensure your data sources are performant, but you no longer have to manage running the Metabase application.</p><h2>Getting help</h2><p>If you still have questions, chances are someone’s already had the same question. Check out the <a>Metabase discussion forum</a>and search for your issue. If you can’t find a solution, submit a question of your own.</p><div><a>« Previous</a><a>Next »</a></div><div><div><p>Did this article help you?

Documentation Title:
Running Metabase on Docker

Documentation Content:
See below for instructions on <a>running Metabase in production</a>.</p><p>Assuming you have <a>Docker</a>installed and running, get the latest Docker image:</p><code>docker pull metabase/metabase:latest
</code><p>Then start the Metabase container:</p><code>docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name metabase metabase/metabase
</code><p>This will launch an Metabase server on port 3000 by default.</p><p>Optional: to view the logs as your Open Source Metabase initializes, run:</p><code>docker logs -f metabase
</code><p>Once startup completes, you can access your Open Source Metabase at <code>http://localhost:3000</code>.</p><p>To run your Open Source Metabase on a different port, say port 12345:</p><code>docker run -d -p 12345:3000 --name metabase metabase/metabase
</code><h2>Pro or Enterprise quick start</h2><p>Use this quick start if you have a <a>license token</a>for a <a>paid version</a>of Metabase, and you want to run Metabase locally.
