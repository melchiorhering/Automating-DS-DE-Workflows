Documentation Title:
Guide to data permissions

Documentation Content:
we’ll revoke <strong>Unrestricted</strong>access to the database for All Users, because Metabase grants the <em>most permissive</em>level of access across all the groups that someone belongs to.</p><p>You can’t remove anyone from the All Users group, so if you give All Users <strong>Unrestricted</strong>permissions to the Sample Database, then that’ll always be the most permissive setting for everyone who uses your Metabase, regardless of any other group that you put people in.</p><ol><li>Go to <strong>Admin</strong>&gt; <strong>Permissions</strong>&gt; <strong>Database</strong>&gt; <strong>Sample Database</strong>.</li><li>Click on the dropdown menu at the <strong>All Users</strong>row and <strong>Data access</strong>column.</li><li>Select <strong>No self-service</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Save changes</strong>in the banner that appears at the top.</li></ol><p>Selecting <strong>No self-service</strong>for All Users to the Sample Database will:</p><ul><p>Prevent All Users from seeing any data from the Sample Database in the <a>data browser</a>.</p><p>Prevent All Users from using the query builder to create questions using data from the Sample Database.</p><p>Continue to allow All Users to <em>view the results</em>(but not access the underlying data) from questions and dashboards that use Sample Database tables, as long as these questions and dashboards are saved in collections that match the <a>collection permissions</a>for your All Users group.</p></ul><h2>Configuring native query editing permissions</h2><p>Changing All Users’ data permissions from <strong>Unrestricted</strong>to <strong>No self-service</strong>(at the database level) will also revoke All Users’ native query editing permissions to every table in that database.

Documentation Title:
Setting up Metabase

Documentation Content:
Metabase comes with a <a>Sample Database</a>that you can play around with to get a feel for how Metabase works.</p><p>If you’re ready to connect, here’s what you’ll need:</p><ul><li>The <strong>hostname</strong>of the server where your database lives</li><li>The <strong>port</strong>the database server uses</li><li>The <strong>database name</strong></li><li>The <strong>username</strong>you use for the database</li><li>The <strong>password</strong>you use for the database</li></ul><p>If you don’t have this information handy, the person responsible for administering the database should have it.</p><h2>Connect to your database</h2><p>Now that you have your database info you can connect to your database. Sweet, sweet data at last. Just go ahead and put your info into this form and click <strong>Next</strong>.</p><p>For more on connecting to databases, see <a>Adding and managing databases</a>.</p><h2>Usage data preferences</h2><p>One last quick thing that you’ll have to decide is if it’s okay for us to collect some anonymous info about how you use the product — it helps us make Metabase better. Like the box says:</p><ul><li>Metabase never collects anything about your data or question results.</li><li>All collection is completely anonymous.</li><li>Collection can be turned off at any point in your admin settings.</li></ul><p>If you’re ready to start using Metabase, go ahead and click <strong>Next</strong>.</p><h2>Staying in touch</h2><p>At this point you are all set and ready to use Metabase. Since we like keeping in touch with our friends we made it easy to sign up for our newsletter (infrequent emails) with a single click!</p><p>Once you’re done here simply follow the link to <strong>Take me to Metabase</strong>.
