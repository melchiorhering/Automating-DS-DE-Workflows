Maps
When you select the
Map
visualization, Metabase will automatically try and pick the best kind of map to use based on the table or result set.
Formatting data in charts
While we’re talking about formatting, we thought you should also know that you can access formatting options for the columns used in a chart. Just open the visualization settings and select the
Data
tab:
Then click on the gear icon next to the column that you want to format. Dates, numbers, and currencies tend to have the most useful formatting options.

Questions
Visualizing data
While tables are useful for looking up information or finding specific numbers, it’s usually easier to see trends and make sense of data using charts.
To change how the answer to your question is displayed, click on the
Visualization
button in the bottom-left of the screen to open the visualization sidebar.
If a particular visualization doesn’t really make sense for your answer, that option will appear in the “Other charts” section. You can still select one of these other charts, though you might need to fiddle with the chart options to make the chart work with your data.
Not sure which visualization type to use? Check out
Which chart should you use?
Visualization options
Each visualization type has its own advanced options.
To change the settings for a specific chart, for example a row chart, you could either:
Click on the gear icon in the bottom left of the chart (next to the
Visualization
button, or
Click on
Visualization
in the bottom left of the chart, then hover over the currently selected chart and click on the
gear
icon that pops up.
Visualization types
Metabase ships with a bunch of different visualizations types:
Numbers
The
Numbers
option is for displaying a single number, nice and big.
Trends
The
Trend
visualization is great for displaying how a single number has changed between two time periods.
Detail
The
Detail
visualization shows a single result record (row) in an easy-to-read, two-column display.
Progress bars
Progress bars
are for comparing a single number to a goal value that you set.
Gauges
Gauges
allow you to show a single number in the context of a set of colored ranges that you can specify.

Troubleshooting Guide
Troubleshooting question and dashboard visualizations
To start, check if your current browser settings are compatible with Metabase:
Clear your browser cache, and refresh your page.
Disable all extensions and plugins. Load the page again.
Give it one last shot—try opening your page in a private/incognito session, or a different browser.
Formatting dashboard cards
Make sure that you’re making and saving changes from the
card’s settings
(
not
the original question’s settings).
Reset your card’s visualization settings
.
Explanation
The visualization settings on a card are independent of the settings on the original question. When you first create a question, your selected visualization type is saved along with the query. When you add that question to a dashboard, the dashboard will display the same visualization as the original question by default. You can override the original visualization type by using the
card’s visualization settings
.
Visualizing SQL questions
Go to your SQL question and
change the visualization type
to a table. Then, check if any of the following situations apply to the raw query results:
Aggregations (counts, sums, etc.) are wrong
.
Results have duplicated rows
.
Results are missing rows
.
Explanation
If your question or dashboard card is powered by a handwritten
SQL query
rather than the
query builder
, your visualization is going to be more sensitive to changes in the underlying data (for example, renamed fields, or the sudden appearance of a wild null value). To learn more, read about
Common reasons for unexpected query results
.
If you’re having problems with things like SQL syntax errors or
SQL variables
, see
Troubleshooting SQL questions
for more help.
