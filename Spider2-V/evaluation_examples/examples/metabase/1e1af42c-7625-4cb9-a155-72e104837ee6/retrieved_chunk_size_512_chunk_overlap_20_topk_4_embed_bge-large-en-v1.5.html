Then <strong>Visualize</strong>the results.</p><p>Once you’re viewing the Orders table, click <strong>Summarize</strong>. Scroll down and select <code>Total</code>, and click the <code>+</code>button to add the grouping. Metabase will automatically create a histogram for you!</p><p>The histogram shows that customers are most likely to make purchases totaling in the $40-60 range. If you hover over one of the bars, Metabase will display the count of orders in that range. You can also click on a bar to <a>drill-through the data</a>and see the orders that compose the bar.</p><h2>Edit a histogram</h2><p>Metabase gives you <a>a lot of knobs for customizing a bar chart</a>. For now, we’ll hone in on the settings that make histograms shine.</p><p>Metabase will automatically set the number of bins, but you can change how Metabase bins the data. Click <strong>Summarize</strong>, scroll down to <code># Total</code>, and click on <code>Auto binned</code>. A dropdown menu will present the options: <code>Auto bin</code>, 10, 50, or 100 bins, or <code>Don't bin</code>.</p><p>Click the <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>Axes</strong>. The x-axis scale currently says <code>Histogram</code>. Metabase detects when your <a>bar chart</a>should present as a histogram, and selects the best x-axis scale for your visualization.</p><p>If you toggle between the three options, you’ll see that <code>Histogram</code>is the only axes option in which the bars are flush with each other. The flush bars communicate that the x-axis represents a continuous range of data. Linear axes are good for displaying data in categories. Ordinal axes are good for displaying data that’s grouped in distinct number categories.

and how Metabase makes it easy to create histograms.</h3></header><ul><a>Histograms versus bar charts</a><a>Create a histogram</a><a>Edit a histogram</a><a>Further reading</a></ul><p>We’ll walk through creating a <strong>histogram</strong>, which is a type of bar chart that displays groups of data across a continuous range. Histograms are helpful for gaining insights into how much of an item people are likely to buy, the price range they are likely to purchase within, or even the time of year that most people make purchases.</p><h2>Histograms versus bar charts</h2><p>Histograms are a type of <a>bar chart</a>. While the bars on a typical bar chart represent categorical groups, the bars on a histogram represent ranges along a continuous, quantifiable spectrum.</p><p>In other words, you split the data into bins in order to view the distribution of values within a range. The bins are of equal length (and can be empty), and the bins are contiguous. The height of each bar represents the count (or proportion) of the items in the bin. The number of bins is up to the user, though Metabase will automatically select the number of bins for you.</p><p>Here’s a bar chart that displays the count of people from the People table grouped by referral source.</p><p>Here’s the histogram we’ll create in <a>the walkthrough below</a>.</p><p>Metabase makes it easy to create a histogram. In fact, if the data is suitable for a histogram, Metabase will automatically create a histogram for you.</p><h2>Create a histogram</h2><p>Follow along with Metabase’s <strong>Sample Database</strong>to create the histogram detailed below.</p><p>Select <strong>+ New</strong>&gt; <strong>Question</strong>. In the <strong>Query Builder</strong>under <strong>Pick your starting data</strong>, choose <strong>Raw Data</strong>&gt; <strong>Sample Database</strong>, and select the <code>Orders</code>table.

Guide to line charts

Documentation Content:
To create a line chart, you’ll need to pick a metric for Metabase to plot over time. For example, you could show order totals over time by setting the x axis to <code>created_at</code>and the y axis to <code>total</code>. Metabase will automatically plot the line chart:</p><p>That’s technically a line chart, but it looks more like the cardiograph of a startled hummingbird, and that’s even after Metabase has truncated the results shown. (If you hover over the gray warning triangle in the upper right, you’ll see that Metabase has only plotted 2,000 rows.)</p><p>To make the chart more legible, we can summarize the data, so each point on the line chart is an aggregate of rows—“buckets” of records. (It’s much more common to plot unaggregated rows in visualizations like <a>pin maps</a>, or a <a>scatterplot</a>, e.g., to show each product plotted by price and rating.)</p><p>As an example of an aggregated metric, let’s plot the sum of order totals for each month. Click on the green <strong>Summarize button</strong>to pull up the <strong>Summarize sidebar</strong>. Metabase defaults to counting the records, but we’re not interested in the number of orders, so we’ll click on <code>Count</code>and change it to <code>Sum of</code>and select the <code>Total</code>column from <code>Order</code>.</p><p>Next, we’ll want to group our order totals by month. In the <strong>Group by</strong>section, under <code>Order</code>, mouse over the <code>Created At</code>field click on the <code>+</code>button to add the grouping.</p><p>As soon as you add the grouping, Metabase updates the chart:</p><p>This chart is a lot easier to read.
