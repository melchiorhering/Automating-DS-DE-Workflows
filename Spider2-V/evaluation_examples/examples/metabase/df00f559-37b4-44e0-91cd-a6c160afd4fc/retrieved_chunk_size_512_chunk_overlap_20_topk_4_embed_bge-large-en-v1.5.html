You can still select one of these other charts, though you might need to fiddle with the chart options to make the chart work with your data.</p><p>Not sure which visualization type to use?

At their most general, funnels show you values broken out by steps, and the percent decrease between each successive step.</p><h2>Maps</h2><p>When you select the <a>Map</a>visualization, Metabase will automatically try and pick the best kind of map to use based on the table or result set.</p><h2>Formatting data in charts</h2><p>While we’re talking about formatting, we thought you should also know that you can access formatting options for the columns used in a chart. Just open the visualization settings and select the <code>Data</code>tab:</p><p>Then click on the gear icon next to the column that you want to format. Dates, numbers, and currencies tend to have the most useful formatting options.</p><h2>Further reading</h2><ul><a>Charts with multiple series</a><a>Appearance</a><a>BI dashboard best practices</a></ul></article><p>Read docs for other <a>versions of Metabase</a>.

Visualize your data as a histogram

Documentation Content:
Then <strong>Visualize</strong>the results.</p><p>Once you’re viewing the Orders table, click <strong>Summarize</strong>. Scroll down and select <code>Total</code>, and click the <code>+</code>button to add the grouping. Metabase will automatically create a histogram for you!</p><p>The histogram shows that customers are most likely to make purchases totaling in the $40-60 range. If you hover over one of the bars, Metabase will display the count of orders in that range. You can also click on a bar to <a>drill-through the data</a>and see the orders that compose the bar.</p><h2>Edit a histogram</h2><p>Metabase gives you <a>a lot of knobs for customizing a bar chart</a>. For now, we’ll hone in on the settings that make histograms shine.</p><p>Metabase will automatically set the number of bins, but you can change how Metabase bins the data. Click <strong>Summarize</strong>, scroll down to <code># Total</code>, and click on <code>Auto binned</code>. A dropdown menu will present the options: <code>Auto bin</code>, 10, 50, or 100 bins, or <code>Don't bin</code>.</p><p>Click the <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>Axes</strong>. The x-axis scale currently says <code>Histogram</code>. Metabase detects when your <a>bar chart</a>should present as a histogram, and selects the best x-axis scale for your visualization.</p><p>If you toggle between the three options, you’ll see that <code>Histogram</code>is the only axes option in which the bars are flush with each other. The flush bars communicate that the x-axis represents a continuous range of data. Linear axes are good for displaying data in categories. Ordinal axes are good for displaying data that’s grouped in distinct number categories.
