## üì¢ Updates

- 2024-07-16: We released our [environment and dataset](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2-V), [website](https://spider2-v.github.io/) and [arxiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10956). Check it out!

## üèóÔ∏è Installation
### üíæ On Your Desktop or Server
The executable environment~(desktop Ubuntu 22.04 LTS) is based on our previous work [OSWord](https://github.com/xlang-ai/OSWorld). Please install the pip dependencies and virtual machine first.

1. First, clone this repository and `cd` into it. Then, install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. It is recommended that you use the latest version of `conda` to manage the environment, but you can also choose to manually install the dependencies. Please ensure that the version of Python is >= 3.11.
```bash
# Clone the Spider2-V repository
git clone https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2-V

# Change directory into the cloned repository
cd Spider2-V

# Optional: Create a Conda environment for Spider2-V
conda create -n spider2v python=3.11
conda activate spider2v

# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Install [VMware Workstation Pro](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro/workstation-pro-evaluation.html) (for systems with Apple Chips, you should install [VMware Fusion](https://www.vmware.com/go/getfusion)) and append the `vmrun` command into system path.  The installation process can refer to [How to install VMware Worksation Pro](./INSTALL_VMWARE.md). Verify the successful installation by running the following:
```bash
vmrun -T ws list
```
If the installation along with the environment variable set is successful, you will see the message showing the current running virtual machines.
> **Note:** We will also support using [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) in the near future if you have issues with VMware Pro.

3. Install other dependencies like Playwright.
```bash
playwright install chromium
```
All set! Now, you/agent can interact with the environment via the [Quick Start](#-quick-start) below.


### üöÄ Quick Start
Run the following minimal example to interact with the environment:
- It will automatically download the prepared virtual machine from Huggingface (for [arm64](https://huggingface.co/datasets/xlangai/ubuntu_spider2v/blob/main/ubuntu-arm.zip) and for [x86](https://huggingface.co/datasets/xlangai/ubuntu_spider2v/blob/main/ubuntu-x86.zip)) into `./vm_data`, configure the environment, and take one snapshot called `init_state` for you.
```python
from desktop_env.envs.desktop_env import DesktopEnv

# feel free to change the example!
# task instruction: Help me materialize the asset top10_story_ids in this dagster project in the UI. Do NOT materialize other assets.
example_path = 'evlauation_examples/examples/dagster/22ef9058-6188-422a-9c12-e6934e4ed936/22ef9058-6188-422a-9c12-e6934e4ed936.json'
with open(example_path, 'r') as infile:
    example = json.load(infile)

env = DesktopEnv(action_space="pyautogui")

obs = env.reset(task_config=example)
print(f'Task instruction: {example["instruction"]}')
obs, reward, done, info = env.step("pyautogui.rightClick()")
input('Now, you can finish the task in the virtual machine manually and Press ENTER to evaluate ...')
score = env.evaluate()
print(f'Evaluation score: {float(score):.1f}')
env.close()
```
You will see all the logs of the system running normally, including the successful creation of the environment, completion of setup, and successful execution of a `rightClick` action on the screen, which means you are ready to continue.

## üß™ Experiments

A quick glance on the success rates of state-of-the-art VLM agents.

| VLM            | Abstract | Verbose | Account | Non-Account | Overall  |
| -------------- | -------- | ------- | ------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Claude-3-Opus  | 5.3      | 10.9    | 5.9     | 9.3         | 8.1      |
| Gemini-Pro-1.5 | 6.1      | 12.1    | 8.8     | 9.3         | 9.1      |
| GPT-4o         | 11.3     | 16.2    | 10.6    | 15.6        | 13.8     |
| GPT-4V         | 11.3     | 16.6    | 11.2    | 15.4        | **14.0** |

### üï∏Ô∏è Different Data Splits
The entire task set contains $494$ examples (`evaluation_examples/test_all.json`) covering $20$ applications. There are different categories to split the entire task set into subsets, depending on:
- whether the task instruction is *verbose* or *abstract* (`evaluation_examples/test_verbose.json` and `evaluation_examples/test_abstract.json`)
- whether a real account is needed (`evaluation_examples/test_account.json` and `evaluation_examples/test_non_account.json`)
- etc.

Note that, *verbose* instruction means we explicitly tell the agent how to complete the task step-by-step. If you want to test examples which require real accounts (e.g., Snowflake and Google BigQuery), please register relevant accounts and fill credentials into template files under folder `evaluation_examples/settings` first (see [Account Guideline](ACCOUNT_GUIDELINE.md) for more step-by-step details).

With respect to the task format, see [Task Format](evaluation_examples/README.md#task-format).

### üë∑ Human Validation
If you want to check more examples manually in the virtual machine on a GUI screen, which includes:
1. reseting the environment;
2. completing the task in the virtual machine by yourself;
3. invoking the customized evaluation function after completion,
you can run the following interactive script:
- if the `--path_to_vm` argument is not specified, the script will automatically find available virtual machines under folder `./vm_data`. If not found, it will download our prepared VM from Huggingface (for [arm64](https://huggingface.co/datasets/xlangai/ubuntu_spider2v/blob/main/ubuntu-arm.zip) and for [x86](https://huggingface.co/datasets/xlangai/ubuntu_spider2v/blob/main/ubuntu-x86.zip)) into `./vm_data` and use it
- if the `--snapshot` argument is not specified, it will use snapshot with name `init_state` by default
- if the `--example` argument is not specified, it will test on one example `evaluation_examples/test_one.json` by default
```bash
python run_spider2v_human.py --snapshot init_state --example evaluation_examples/test_non_account.json
```

### üíª Agent Baselines
If you wish to run the baseline agent used in our paper, you can execute the following command as an example under the GPT4-o pyautogui+SoM+ExecutionFeedback+RAG setting:

Set **OPENAI_API_KEY** environment variable with your API key:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='changme'
```

```bash
python run_spider2v_agent.py --snapshot init_state \
    --model gpt-4o-2024-05-13 \
    --headless \
    --action_space pyautogui \
    --observation_space som \
    --execution_feedback \
    --rag \
    --result_dir ./results \
    --example evaluation_examples/test_non_account.json
```
The results, which include screenshots, a11y trees, actions, and video recordings of the agent's task completion, will be saved in the `./results` directory.

> If you want to use other models, you can revise the code file `mm_agents/agent.py`.


## ‚ùì FAQ

| GPT-4o  | 8.7m         | 0.32M                 | 1.6K                      | $1.64        |
| GPT-4V  | 9.1m         | 0.32M                 | 1.8K                      | $3.29        |

- action_space = pyautogui, observation_space = SoM
- history_trajectory_length = 3, max_steps = 15, RAG = True
- prompt tokens include image pixels. Calculated per task in June 2024.
