## AI Agent Explained:

# SOLUTION/RESEARCH IDEAS

## ADD A REAL RAG:

- Add [SurreaDB](https://surrealdb.com/) as vectordb
- Store documentation in there (and keep updating it as vector)

## Store failed attempts/

## To learn from

## Improve the code structure (its really messy atm):

- ### [Atomic-Agents](https://github.com/BrainBlend-AI/atomic-agents)
  - lightweight and modular
  - Build on top of [Instructor](https://python.useinstructor.com/) and [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/)
  - Uses schemas to validation and serialize data.
  - Modularity: Build AI applications by combining small, reusable components.
  - Predictability: Define clear input and output schemas to ensure consistent behavior.
  - Extensibility: Easily swap out components or integrate new ones without disrupting the entire system.
  - Control: Fine-tune each part of the system individually, from system prompts to tool integrations.

## 1. Action Grounding

### Problem:

GUI interaction accuracy is low due to incorrect identification of UI elements.

### Solution:

- **Vision-Enhanced Training**:
  - Use datasets specifically designed for GUI navigation tasks, such as labeled screenshots paired with correct actions.
  - Pre-train models on synthetic GUIs with known structures to improve the agentâ€™s visual recognition.
- **Fine-Grained GUI Controls**:
  - Improve coordinate prediction models for actions like clicking or dragging.
  - Implement mechanisms to predict sequences of dependent actions accurately (e.g., navigating a menu before clicking).
- **Modal Alignment**:
  - Enhance techniques like Set-of-Mark to ensure better alignment between screenshots and accessibility trees (a11ytree).

## 2. Contextual Understanding and Long Histories

### Problem:

Tasks requiring multi-step dependencies (e.g., workflows with 15+ actions) see high failure rates.

### Solution:

- **History-Aware Models**:
  - Train models to incorporate longer trajectories of past actions and observations using memory-augmented neural networks or attention-based mechanisms.
- **Efficient State Representations**:
  - Reduce state complexity by summarizing task history into a compact representation to maintain computational efficiency.

## 3. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

### Problem:

Agents struggle to effectively use external documentation.

### Solution:

- **Better Document Preprocessing**:
  - Improve heuristics for filtering irrelevant content in crawled documentation (e.g., focus on user guides, tutorials, and API references).
  - Generate synthetic queries from instructions to validate document relevancy.
- **Fine-Tuned Retrieval Models**:
  - Fine-tune document retrieval systems for enterprise-specific applications like BigQuery or Snowflake.
  - Embed context-aware retrieval within the task loop to ensure relevant information is dynamically fetched.

## 4. Step-by-Step Guidance

### Problem:

Tasks with verbose instructions perform better than those with abstract instructions.

### Solution:

- **Intermediate Planning**:
  - Train models to break abstract instructions into intermediate steps before execution.
  - Fine-tune on datasets where abstract instructions are paired with step-by-step plans.
- **Reasoning Models**:
  - Use chain-of-thought prompting or similar techniques to improve reasoning and step derivation from abstract descriptions.

## 5. Dynamic Adaptation to Real-World Challenges

### Problem:

Tasks involving authentic user accounts, network delays, or cloud-hosted services have lower success rates.

### Solution:

- **Simulated Latency**:
  - Include realistic delay simulations in the training environment to build robustness to network and UI lag.
- **Error Recovery**:
  - Train agents to detect and recover from errors dynamically (e.g., retrying actions after failed executions or navigating back to the previous state).
- **Cloud-Specific Tuning**:
  - Pre-train models on cloud-specific workflows, including authentication, navigating pop-ups, and handling API interactions.

## 6. Improving CLI and Code Generation

### Problem:

Code-related tasks, such as writing SQL or Python scripts, suffer from misinterpretations.

### Solution:

- **Code-Aware Training**:
  - Train models using datasets of real-world enterprise code snippets and workflows (e.g., SQL queries for Snowflake or Python scripts for Airflow).
- **Error Feedback Integration**:
  - Incorporate runtime feedback during task execution to allow the model to correct syntax or logic errors.

---

## 7. Robust Evaluation and Error Analysis

### Problem:

Errors in intermediate steps cascade, causing entire task sequences to fail.

### Solution:

- **Iterative Error Analysis**:
  - Identify common failure points (e.g., incorrect element selection, incomplete SQL queries) and address them through targeted training.
- **Modular Evaluation**:
  - Evaluate task performance in stages to diagnose which components (GUI interaction, code generation, etc.) are causing the most failures.

---

## 8. Hyperparameter Optimization

### Problem:

Suboptimal model configurations limit performance.

### Solution:

- **Interaction Parameters**:
  - Optimize the number of interaction turns and history window sizes for specific task categories.
- **Sampling Techniques**:
  - Experiment with temperature and top-p sampling to balance diversity and precision in action prediction.

---

## 9. Task-Specific Fine-Tuning

### Problem:

Diverse task categories (e.g., warehousing, ingestion, orchestration) require different skills.

### Solution:

- Fine-tune models separately for each task type (e.g., SQL generation for warehousing, GUI manipulation for visualization).
- Use task-specific evaluation metrics during training to ensure models generalize well within each domain.

---

## 10. Human-in-the-Loop Training

### Problem:

Models fail on nuanced tasks involving ambiguous instructions or unexpected UI changes.

### Solution:

- **Interactive Feedback**:
  - Incorporate human annotations for ambiguous tasks to refine the model's decision-making process.
- **Adaptive Learning**:
  - Use reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to fine-tune model responses to enterprise scenarios.

---

## 11. Environment Enhancements

### Problem:

Current training environments lack realistic multi-application coordination.

### Solution:

- **Cross-Application Workflows**:
  - Simulate scenarios involving multiple tools (e.g., transferring data from Airbyte to BigQuery, visualizing with Superset) to train agents for seamless transitions.
- **Improved Task Simulations**:
  - Include edge cases like misconfigured environments, incomplete inputs, and multi-language tasks.

---

### Summary

Improving Spider2-V benchmark scores requires targeted enhancements in:

- **Model architecture** (e.g., better action grounding, contextual understanding).
- **Task-specific fine-tuning** for diverse workflows.
- **Environment simulation** to build real-world robustness.
- **Documentation integration** for retrieval-augmented decision-making.
