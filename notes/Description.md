This thesis will look at methods for addressing the new Spider-v2 Task ([https://spider2-v.github.io/](https://spider2-v.github.io/)): “Spider2-V is a multimodal agent benchmark spanning across the entire data science and engineering workflow (e.g., five task examples above). It involves various professional enterprise-level applications and includes intensive GUI controls apart from code writing throughout the real-time multi-turn interaction with an executable computer environment.” The aim would be to setup the environment and then propose 1 or 2 new variations on the baseline to try and improve performance on this complex task.

### **Work Environment**

The work will be done in the context of the IvI INDElab ([https://indelab.org/](https://indelab.org/)) and be supervised by Paul Groth.
