    "instruction": "Complete the model \"dim_customers.sql\" by adding an additional column with boolean values named \"is_valid_email_address\". Then execute it to create the transformed table \"dim_customers\", which stores customers who have provided a valid email address before those who have not. An email address is valid if it is in the format of \"[address]@[valid_TLD]\", and all valid TLDs are extracted by model \"top_level_email_domains.sql\".\nHere is a step-by-step tutorial from an expert instructing you how to complete it:\nThis task requires you to write some sql codes to select a certain column.\n1. Open the file ``models/dim_customers.sql`` in the VSCode editor.\n2. Append the following SQL codes in the select block (there is a comment indicating the target location).\n```sql\n    coalesce (regexp_matches(\n        customers.email, '^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Za-z]{2,}$'\n    )\n    = true\n    and accepted_email_domains.tld is not null,\n    false) as is_valid_email_address\nfrom customers\n    left join accepted_email_domains\n    on customers.email_top_level_domain = lower(accepted_email_domains.tld)\n```\n3. Switch to the terminal.\n4. Run ``dbt build`` to load the seeds and execute the models.\nYou can exactly follow the detailed plan above or proactively tackle the task based on the real-time environment interaction by yourself.",
