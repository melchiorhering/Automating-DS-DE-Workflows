This task requires you to build a Decision Tree model to classify the onset of diabetes based on different diagnostic measures.
1. Add the following code below the ``#TODO 1`` comment.
```python
X = pima[feature_cols]
y = pima.label
```
2. Add the following code below the ``#TODO 2`` comment. First, instantiate a decision tree model.
```python
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=SEED)
```
3. Then, add the following code afterward to fit the decision tree model.
```python
clf = clf.fit(X_train,y_train)
```
4. Finally, add the following code afterward to predict the response for the test dataset.
```python
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
```
5. Click the button "Run" in the menu bar on the top.
6. In the drop-down menu, select and click "Run All Cells".
7. Wait until all cells completes running, then click the button "File" in the menu bar on the top.
8. In the drop-down menu, select and click "Save All".
