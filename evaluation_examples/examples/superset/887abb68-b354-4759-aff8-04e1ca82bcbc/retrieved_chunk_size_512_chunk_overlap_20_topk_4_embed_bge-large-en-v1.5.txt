Next, in the Time Comparison subsection of
Advanced Analytics
, enter the Time Shift by typing in
“minus 1 week” (note this box accepts input in natural language). Run Query to see the new chart,
which has an additional series with the same values, shifted a week back in time.
Then, change the
Calculation type
to Absolute difference and select
Run Query
. We can now
see only one series again, this time showing the difference between the two series we saw
previously.
Save the chart as Tutorial Time Comparison and add it to the Tutorial Dashboard.
Resampling the data
​
In this section, we’ll resample the data so that rather than having daily data we have weekly data.
As in the previous section, reopen the Tutorial Advanced Analytics Base chart.
Next, in the Python Functions subsection of
Advanced Analytics
, enter 7D, corresponding to seven
days, in the Rule and median as the Method and show the chart by selecting
Run Query
.
Note that now we have a single data point every 7 days. In our case, the value showed corresponds to
the median value within the seven daily data points. For more information on the meaning of the
various options in this section, refer to the
Pandas documentation
.
Lastly, save your chart as Tutorial Resample and add it to the Tutorial Dashboard. Go to the
tutorial dashboard to see the four charts side by side and compare the different outputs.

By the
end of this section, you will have created a table that shows the monthly spend on flights for the
first six months, by department, by travel class.
Create a new chart by selecting
+ ‣ Chart
from the top right corner. Choose
tutorial_flights again as a datasource, then click on the visualization type to get to the
visualization menu. Select the
Pivot Table
visualization (you can filter by entering text in the
search box) and then
Create New Chart
.
In the
Time
section, keep the Time Column as Travel Date (this is selected automatically as we
only have one time column in our dataset). Then select Time Grain to be month as having daily data
would be too granular to see patterns from. Then select the time range to be the first six months of
2011 by click on Last week in the Time Range section, then in Custom selecting a Start / end of 1st
January 2011 and 30th June 2011 respectively by either entering directly the dates or using the
calendar widget (by selecting the month name and then the year, you can move more quickly to far
away dates).
Next, within the
Query
section, remove the default COUNT(
*
) and add Cost, keeping the default
SUM aggregate. Note that Apache Superset will indicate the type of the metric by the symbol on the
left hand column of the list (ABC for string, # for number, a clock face for time, etc.).
In
Group by
select
Time
: this will automatically use the Time Column and Time Grain
selections we defined in the Time section.
Within
Columns
, select first Department and then Travel Class. All set – let’s
Run Query
to
see some data!
You should see months in the rows and Department and Travel Class in the columns. Publish this chart
to your existing Tutorial Dashboard you created earlier.
Line Chart
​
In this section, we are going to create a line chart to understand the average price of a ticket by
month across the entire dataset.
In the Time section, as before, keep the Time Column as Travel Date and Time Grain as month but this
time for the Time range select No filter as we want to look at entire dataset.

The three types of transformation are:
Setting up the base chart
In this section, we’re going to set up a base chart which we can then apply the different
Advanced
Analytics
features to. Start off by creating a new chart using the same
tutorial_flights
datasource and the
Line Chart
visualization type. Within the Time section, set the Time Range as
1st October 2011 and 31st October 2011.
Next, in the query section, change the Metrics to the sum of Cost. Select
Run Query
to show the
chart. You should see the total cost per day for each month in October 2011.
Finally, save the visualization as Tutorial Advanced Analytics Base, adding it to the Tutorial
Dashboard.
Rolling Mean
​
There is quite a lot of variation in the data, which makes it difficult to identify any trend. One
approach we can take is to show instead a rolling average of the time series. To do this, in the
Moving Average
subsection of
Advanced Analytics
, select mean in the
Rolling
box and
enter 7 into both Periods and Min Periods. The period is the length of the rolling period expressed
as a multiple of the Time Grain. In our example, the Time Grain is day, so the rolling period is 7
days, such that on the 7th October 2011 the value shown would correspond to the first seven days of
October 2011. Lastly, by specifying Min Periods as 7, we ensure that our mean is always calculated
on 7 days and we avoid any ramp up period.
After displaying the chart by selecting
Run Query
you will see that the data is less variable
and that the series starts later as the ramp up period is excluded.
Save the chart as Tutorial Rolling Mean and add it to the Tutorial Dashboard.
Time Comparison
​
In this section, we will compare values in our time series to the value a week before. Start off by
opening the Tutorial Advanced Analytics Base chart, by going to
Charts
in the top menu and then
selecting the visualization name in the list (alternatively, find the chart in the Tutorial
Dashboard and select Explore chart from the menu for that visualization).

Click on the entry to
launch an Explore workflow using this dataset.
In this section, we'll create a table visualization
to show the number of flights and cost per travel class.
By default, Apache Superset only shows the last week of data. In our example, we want to visualize all
of the data in the dataset. Click the
Time ‣ Time Range
section and change
the
Range Type
to
No Filter
.
Click
Apply
to save.
Now, we want to specify the rows in our table by using the
Group by
option. Since in this
example, we want to understand different Travel Classes, we select
Travel Class
in this menu.
Next, we can specify the metrics we would like to see in our table with the
Metrics
option.
COUNT(*)
, which represents the number of rows in the table
(in this case, quantity of flights in each Travel Class)
SUM(Cost)
, which represents the total cost spent by each Travel Class
Finally, select
Run Query
to see the results of the table.
To save the visualization, click on
Save
in the top left of the screen. In the following modal,
Select the
Save as
option and enter the chart name as Tutorial Table (you will be able to find it again through the
Charts
screen, accessible in the top menu).
Select
Add To Dashboard
and enter
Tutorial Dashboard. Finally, select
Save & Go To Dashboard
.
Dashboard Basics
​
Next, we are going to explore the dashboard interface. If you’ve followed the previous section, you
should already have the dashboard open. Otherwise, you can navigate to the dashboard by selecting
Dashboards on the top menu, then Tutorial dashboard from the list of dashboards.
On this dashboard you should see the table you created in the previous section. Select
Edit
dashboard
and then hover over the table. By selecting the bottom right hand corner of the table
(the cursor will change too), you can resize it by dragging and dropping.
Finally, save your changes by selecting Save changes in the top right.
Pivot Table
​
In this section, we will extend our analysis using a more complex visualization, Pivot Table.
