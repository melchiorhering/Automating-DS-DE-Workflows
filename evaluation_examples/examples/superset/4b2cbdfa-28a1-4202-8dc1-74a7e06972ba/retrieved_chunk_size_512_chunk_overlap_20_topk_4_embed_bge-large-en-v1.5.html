Exploring Data in Superset | Superset

Documentation Content:
The following section
explains how to enable this functionality for the examples database.</p><p>In the top menu, select <strong>Data ‣ Databases</strong>. Find the <strong>examples</strong>database in the list and
select the <strong>Edit</strong>button.</p><p>In the resulting modal window, switch to the <strong>Extra</strong>tab and
tick the checkbox for <strong>Allow Data Upload</strong>. End by clicking the <strong>Save</strong>button.</p><h3>Loading CSV Data<a>​</a></h3><p>Download the CSV dataset to your computer from
<a>GitHub</a>.
In the Superset menu, select <strong>Data ‣ Upload a CSV</strong>.</p><p>Then, enter the <strong>Table Name</strong>as <em>tutorial_flights</em>and select the CSV file from your computer.</p><p>Next enter the text <em>Travel Date</em>into the <strong>Parse Dates</strong>field.</p><p>Leaving all the other options in their default settings, select <strong>Save</strong>at the bottom of the page.</p><h3>Table Visualization<a>​</a></h3><p>You should now see <em>tutorial_flights</em>as a dataset in the <strong>Datasets</strong>tab. Click on the entry to
launch an Explore workflow using this dataset.</p><p>In this section, we'll create a table visualization
to show the number of flights and cost per travel class.</p><p>By default, Apache Superset only shows the last week of data. In our example, we want to visualize all
of the data in the dataset. Click the <strong>Time ‣ Time Range</strong>section and change
the <strong>Range Type</strong>to <strong>No Filter</strong>.</p><p>Click <strong>Apply</strong>to save.</p><p>Now, we want to specify the rows in our table by using the <strong>Group by</strong>option.

Note that Superset usage has a tendency
to occur in spikes, e.g., if everyone in a meeting loads the same dashboard at once.</p><p>Superset's application metadata does not require a very large database to store it, though
the log file grows over time.</p><h2>Can I join / query multiple tables at one time?<a>​</a></h2><p>Not in the Explore or Visualization UI. A Superset SQLAlchemy datasource can only be a single table
or a view.</p><p>When working with tables, the solution would be to create a table that contains all the fields
needed for your analysis, most likely through some scheduled batch process.</p><p>A view is a simple logical layer that abstracts an arbitrary SQL queries as a virtual table. This can
allow you to join and union multiple tables and to apply some transformation using arbitrary SQL
expressions. The limitation there is your database performance, as Superset effectively will run a
query on top of your query (view). A good practice may be to limit yourself to joining your main
large table to one or many small tables only, and avoid using <em>GROUP BY</em>where possible as Superset
will do its own <em>GROUP BY</em>and doing the work twice might slow down performance.</p><p>Whether you use a table or a view, performance depends on how fast your database can deliver
the result to users interacting with Superset.</p><p>However, if you are using SQL Lab, there is no such limitation. You can write SQL queries to join
multiple tables as long as your database account has access to the tables.</p><h2>How do I create my own visualization?<a>​</a></h2><p>We recommend reading the instructions in
<a>Creating Visualization Plugins</a>.</p><h2>Can I upload and visualize CSV data?<a>​</a></h2><p>Absolutely!

].schema].table name"</span><span>;</span></span><p>For example:</p><span><span>SELECT</span><span>*</span><span>FROM</span><span>"examples.birth_names"</span><span>;</span></span><p>Spaces are allowed, but periods in the names must be replaced by <code>%2E</code>. Eg:</p><span><span>SELECT</span><span>*</span><span>FROM</span><span>"Superset meta database.examples%2Ebirth_names"</span><span>;</span></span><p>The query above returns the same rows as <code>SELECT * FROM "examples.birth_names"</code>, and also shows that the meta database can query tables from any table — even itself!</p><h4>Considerations<a>​</a></h4><p>Before enabling this feature, there are a few considerations that you should have in mind. First, the meta database enforces permissions on the queried tables, so users should only have access via the database to tables that they originally have access to. Nevertheless, the meta database is a new surface for potential attacks, and bugs could allow users to see data they should not.</p><p>Second, there are performance considerations. The meta database will push any filtering, sorting, and limiting to the underlying databases, but any aggregations and joins will happen in memory in the process running the query. Because of this, it's recommended to run the database in async mode, so queries are executed in Celery workers, instead of the web workers. Additionally, it's possible to specify a hard limit on how many rows are returned from the underlying databases.</p><h4>Enabling the meta database<a>​</a></h4><p>To enable the Superset meta database, first you need to set the <code>ENABLE_SUPERSET_META_DB</code>feature flag to true. Then, add a new database of type "Superset meta database" with the SQLAlchemy URI "superset://".</p><p>If you enable DML in the meta database users will be able to run DML queries on underlying databases <strong>as long as DML is also enabled in them</strong>.
