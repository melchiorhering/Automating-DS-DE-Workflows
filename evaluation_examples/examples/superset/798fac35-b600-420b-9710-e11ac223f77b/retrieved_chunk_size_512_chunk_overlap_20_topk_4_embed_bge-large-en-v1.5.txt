Documentation Content:
If you would like to make your dashboard available to other users, simply select Draft next to the
title of your dashboard on the top left to change your dashboard to be in Published state. You can
also favorite this dashboard by selecting the star.
Annotations
​
Annotations allow you to add additional context to your chart. In this section, we will add an
annotation to the Tutorial Line Chart we made in a previous section. Specifically, we will add the
dates when some flights were cancelled by the UK’s Civil Aviation Authority in response to the
eruption of the Grímsvötn volcano in Iceland (23-25 May 2011).
First, add an annotation layer by navigating to Manage ‣ Annotation Layers. Add a new annotation
layer by selecting the green plus sign to add a new record. Enter the name Volcanic Eruptions and
save. We can use this layer to refer to a number of different annotations.
Next, add an annotation by navigating to Manage ‣ Annotations and then create a new annotation by
selecting the green plus sign. Then, select the Volcanic Eruptions layer, add a short description
Grímsvötn and the eruption dates (23-25 May 2011) before finally saving.
Then, navigate to the line chart by going to Charts then selecting Tutorial Line Chart from the
list. Next, go to the Annotations and Layers section and select Add Annotation Layer. Within this
dialogue:
Name the layer as Volcanic Eruptions
Change the Annotation Layer Type to Event
Set the Annotation Source as Superset annotation
Specify the Annotation Layer as Volcanic Eruptions
Select
Apply
to see your annotation shown on the chart.
If you wish, you can change how your annotation looks by changing the settings in the Display
configuration section. Otherwise, select
OK
and finally
Save
to save your chart. If you keep
the default selection to overwrite the chart, your annotation will be saved to the chart and also
appear automatically in the Tutorial Dashboard.
Advanced Analytics
​
In this section, we are going to explore the Advanced Analytics feature of Apache Superset that
allows you to apply additional transformations to your data.

Documentation Title:
Setting up a Development Environment | Superset

Documentation Content:
./scripts/po2json.sh
If you get errors running
po2json
, you might be running the Ubuntu package with the same
name, rather than the Node.js package (they have a different format for the arguments). If
there is a conflict, you may need to update your
PATH
environment variable or fully qualify
the executable path (e.g.
/usr/local/bin/po2json
instead of
po2json
).
If you get a lot of
[null,***]
in
messages.json
, just delete all the
null,
.
For example,
"year":["年"]
is correct while
"year":[null,"年"]
is incorrect.
For the translations to take effect we need to compile translation catalogs into binary MO files.
pybabel compile -d superset/translations
Creating a new language dictionary
​
To create a dictionary for a new language, run the following, where
LANGUAGE_CODE
is replaced with
the language code for your target language, e.g.
es
(see
Flask AppBuilder i18n documentation
for more details):
pip
install
-r superset/translations/requirements.txt
pybabel init -i superset/translations/messages.pot -d superset/translations -l LANGUAGE_CODE
Then,
Updating language files
.
Tips
​
Adding a new datasource
​
Create Models and Views for the datasource, add them under superset folder, like a new my_models.py
with models for cluster, datasources, columns and metrics and my_views.py with clustermodelview
and datasourcemodelview.
Create DB migration files for the new models
Specify this variable to add the datasource model and from which module it is from in config.py:
For example:
ADDITIONAL_MODULE_DS_MAP
=
{
'superset.my_models'
:
[
'MyDatasource'
,
'MyOtherDatasource'
]
}
This means it'll register MyDatasource and MyOtherDatasource in superset.my_models module in the source registry.
Visualization Plugins
​
The topic of authoring new plugins, whether you'd like to contribute
it back or not has been well documented in the
the documentation
, and in
this blog post
.



Documentation Source:
superset.apache.org/docs/contributing/development/index.txt

Documentation Title:
Setting up a Development Environment | Superset

Documentation Content:
To contribute a plugin to Superset, your plugin must meet the following criteria:
The plugin should be applicable to the community at large, not a particularly specialized use case
The plugin should be written with TypeScript
The plugin should contain sufficient unit/e2e tests
The plugin should use appropriate namespacing, e.g. a folder name of
plugin-chart-whatever
and a package name of
@superset-ui/plugin-chart-whatever
The plugin should use them variables via Emotion, as passed in by the ThemeProvider
The plugin should provide adequate error handling (no data returned, malformed data, invalid controls, etc.)
The plugin should contain documentation in the form of a populated
README.md
file
The plugin should have a meaningful and unique icon
Above all else, the plugin should come with a
commitment to maintenance
from the original author(s)
Submissions will be considered for submission (or removal) on a case-by-case basis.
Adding a DB migration
​
Alter the model you want to change. This example will add a
Column
Annotations model.
Example commit
Generate the migration file
superset db migrate -m
'add_metadata_column_to_annotation_model'
This will generate a file in
migrations/version/{SHA}_this_will_be_in_the_migration_filename.py
.
Example commit
Upgrade the DB
superset db upgrade
The output should look like this:
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Context impl SQLiteImpl.
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Will assume transactional DDL.
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Running upgrade 1a1d627ebd8e -> 40a0a483dd12, add_metadata_column_to_annotation_model.py
Add column to view
Since there is a new column, we need to add it to the AppBuilder Model view.
Example commit
Test the migration's
down
method
superset db downgrade
The output should look like this:
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Context impl SQLiteImpl.
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Will assume transactional DDL.
