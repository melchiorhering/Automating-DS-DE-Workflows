2. Select cells A1:B1.
3. Right click and choose "Merge Cells" in the pop-up menu.
4. Input text "Summer sales ($)" in the merged cell.
5. Click "Sheet1" on the bottom to switch to "Sheet1".
6. Press Ctrl+A to select all data in Sheet1.
7. Click "Insert" on the top menu bar. Select "Pivot Table..." in the dropdown menu.

10. Press and drag "Sales Channel" from the available fields to "Column Fields:" in the upper middle.
11. Press and drag "Revenue" from the available fields to "Data Fields:" in the lower middle.
