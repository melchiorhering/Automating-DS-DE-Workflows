1. Go to cell G1. Input "Revenue" in the cell.
2. Select cell G2. Enter the formula "=E2*VLOOKUP(C2,$'Retail Price'.$A$2:$B$23,2,0)*(1-F2)".
3. Move the mouse to the bottom-right of cell G2 (your mouse should look like a cross). Hold and drag the mouse to cell G36.
4. Select columns A to G. Areas of these columns should be highlighted.
5. Click "Insert" on the top menu bar. Select "Pivot Table..." in the dropdown menu.
6. Make sure the selection is "Current selection" and the entire sheet containing data is selected. Then click "OK" on the button-right of the pop-up window.
