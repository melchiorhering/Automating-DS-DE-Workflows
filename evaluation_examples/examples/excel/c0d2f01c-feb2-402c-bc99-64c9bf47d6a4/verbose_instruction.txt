In the task, we are going to repeat the formula from one cell to others and merge contents in multiple columns into a new column. To achieve it:
1. Click cell B2.
2. Move the cursor to the bottom right corner of B2. We will see the mouse becomes a cross.
3. Press and drag down the mouse from cell B2 to cell B30.
4. Click cell D2.
5. Similarly, move the cursor to the bottom right corner of D2. The mouse should become a cross icon.
6. Press and drag down the mouse from cell D2 to cell D30.
7. Next, click cell E1. We will create a new column.
8. Type in column header "Combined Data".
9. Press Enter and locate to cell E2.
10. Type in the following formula:
=$A$1&": "&FIXED(A2,2)&", "&$B$1&": "&FIXED(B2,2)&", "&$C$1&": "&FIXED(C2,2)&", "&$D$1&": "&FIXED(D2,2)
11. Press Enter to make it work.
12. Choose cell E2 and move the cursor to the bottom right corner of this cell.
13. Press and drag down the mouse from cell E2 to cell E30 to repeatively apply the same formula.
14. Finally, press Ctrl+S to save the modifications.
