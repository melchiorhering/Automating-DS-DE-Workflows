In this task, we will use Bigquery Web UI to write code to query `patents-public-data.patents` dataset and save the execution results into a local .csv file. Concretely,
1. Click the triangle symbol to the left of `patents-public-data.patents` to open the datasets and see what tables the datasets have.
2. Click `publications` to see the table schema.
3. Click '+' button at the top of the main panel to **Create SQL query**. This will open a blank query panel.
4. Write the following code into the blank
```
SELECT country_code
FROM (
  SELECT ANY_VALUE(country_code) AS country_code
  FROM `patents-public-data.patents.publications` AS pubs
  GROUP BY application_number
)
GROUP BY country_code
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 10
```
5. Click the "> RUN" button in the menu bar of this panel to execute this SQL;
6. Wait for a moment (about 10 seconds). The query results will show below.
7. Click the "SAVE RESULTS" button above the execution results (on the right side of the same row as panel "Query results");
8. And in the drop-down menu, further click the option "CSV (local file)";
9. Open the terminal and move to the `~/Downloads` folder
10. Change the name of the csv file to result.csv
