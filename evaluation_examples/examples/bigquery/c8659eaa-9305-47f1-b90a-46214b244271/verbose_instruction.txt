In this task, we will use VSCode to write code to query a public dataset `austin_bikeshare` and save the execution results into a local .csv file. Concretely,
1. Click "query.py" in VS Code to see the project code. we can see the code is partially finished, and we need to know the detailed information of austin_bikeshare.
2. Change to Google Chrome or Chromium, we can see one entry of `austin_bikeshare` database in the Explorer panel on the left side.
3. Click the toggle node (a triangular icon) on the left of `austin_bikeshare` in the Explorer panel to expand the tables in this public database.
4. Click row "bikeshare_stations" among the expanded entries, we can see the table schema on the right panel. Among these columns, we are interested in `name`, `footprint_length` and `footprint_width`. Note that, `footprint_length` multiplied by `footprint_width` can be used to calculate the total area.
5. Click "PREVIEW" tab on the right panel, we can see sample data from `bikeshare_stations`.
6. Change to application VSCode.
7. Write the following code into file "query.py"
```
import os
import pandas as pd
from google.cloud import bigquery

def query_data():
    os.environ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"] = "credential.json"
    client = bigquery.Client()
    
    query = """
        SELECT name, (footprint_length * footprint_width) AS area
        FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations`
        ORDER BY area DESC
        LIMIT 10;
    """

    query_job = client.query(query)
    try:
      results = query_job.result().to_dataframe() 
      if results.empty:
        print("No data found for the specified query.")
      else:
        results.to_csv("result.csv", index=False)
        print("Results saved to result.csv")
    except Exception as e:
      print("Error occurred while fetching data: ", e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    query_data()
```
8. Switch to the opened terminal.
9. Type in "python query.py" to run the code. Results will be saved to file 'result.csv' in folder `project1`.
