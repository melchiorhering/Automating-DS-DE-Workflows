Go to BigQuery
In the query editor, enter the following statement:
DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS mydataset;
By default, this only works to delete an empty dataset.
To delete a dataset and all of its contents, use the
CASCADE
keyword:
DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS mydataset CASCADE;
Click
play_circle
Run
.
For more information about how to run queries, see
Run an interactive query
.
bq
Use the
bq rm
command
with the
--dataset
or
-d
flag, which is optional.
If your dataset contains tables, you must use the
-r
flag to
remove all tables in the dataset. If you use the
-r
flag, then you can omit
the
--dataset
or
-d
flag.
After you run the command, the system asks for confirmation. You can use the
-f
flag to skip the confirmation.
If you are deleting a table in a project other than your default project,
add the project ID to the dataset name in the following format:
PROJECT_ID
:
DATASET
.
bq rm -r -f -d
PROJECT_ID
:
DATASET
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID
: your project ID
DATASET
: the name of the dataset that you're deleting
Examples:
Enter the following command to remove a dataset that's named
mydataset
and all
the tables in it from your default project. The command uses the
-d
flag.
bq rm -r -d mydataset
When prompted, type
y
and press enter.
Enter the following command to remove
mydataset
and all the tables in it
from
myotherproject
. The command does not use the optional
-d
flag.
The
-f
flag is used to skip confirmation.
bq rm -r -f myotherproject:mydataset
You can use the
bq ls
command to confirm that the dataset was deleted.
API
Call the
datasets.delete
method
to delete the dataset and set the
deleteContents
parameter to
true
to
delete the tables in it.
C#
The following code sample deletes an empty dataset.

This action deletes the dataset, the table, and all the data.
In the
Delete dataset
dialog box, confirm the delete command by typing
the name of your dataset (
bqml_tutorial
) and then click
Delete
.
Delete your project
To delete the project:
Caution
: Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted.
If you used an existing project for
      the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
      done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
      the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an
appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
    can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
Manage resources
page.
Go to Manage resources
In the project list, select the project that you
    want to delete, and then click
Delete
.
In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click
Shut down
to delete the project.
