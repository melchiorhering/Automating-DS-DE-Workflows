List jobs in a project
BigQuery saves a six-month job history for all the jobs of a project.
You can view the job history in the following ways:
Using the
Google Cloud console
.
Using the
bq ls
command.
Calling the
jobs.list
API method.
Using the client libraries.
The job history includes jobs that are in the
RUNNING
state and jobs that are
DONE
(indicated by reporting the state as
SUCCESS
or
FAILURE
).
Required permissions
To list all of the jobs that you created in a project, you need the
bigquery.jobs.create
IAM permission. To list all of the jobs created by all of the users in a project, you need the
bigquery.jobs.list
IAM permission. You can only see the full details of jobs that you create. The details of jobs created by other users are redacted.
Each of the following predefined IAM roles includes the permissions that you need in order to list jobs:
roles/bigquery.admin
(lets you list all the jobs in the project)
roles/bigquery.user
(lets you list all the jobs in the project)
roles/bigquery.jobUser
(lets you list your jobs)
To list all the jobs in a project, including their details, you need the
bigquery.jobs.listAll
IAM permission.
Each of the following predefined IAM roles includes the permissions that you need in order to list all the jobs, including their details:
roles/bigquery.admin
roles/bigquery.resourceAdmin
For more information about IAM roles and permissions in
BigQuery, see
Predefined roles and permissions
.
List jobs
BigQuery lists jobs for all locations.
To list jobs in a project, do the following:
Console
Go to the
BigQuery
page.
Go to BigQuery
To list all jobs in a project, click

Writing query results  |  BigQuery  |  Google Cloud

from google.cloud import bigquery

# Construct a BigQuery client object.
client = bigquery.Client()

# TODO(developer): Set table_id to the ID of the destination table.
# table_id = "your-project.your_dataset.your_table_name"

# Set the destination table and use_legacy_sql to True to use
# legacy SQL syntax.
job_config = bigquery.QueryJobConfig(
    allow_large_results=True, destination=table_id, use_legacy_sql=True
)

sql = """
    SELECT corpus
    FROM [bigquery-public-data:samples.shakespeare]
    GROUP BY corpus;
"""

# Start the query, passing in the extra configuration.
query_job = client.query(sql, job_config=job_config)  # Make an API request.
query_job.result()  # Wait for the job to complete.

print("Query results loaded to the table {}".format(table_id))
Downloading and saving query results from the Google Cloud console
After you run a SQL query by using the Google Cloud console, you can save the
results to another location. You can use the Google Cloud console to download
query results to a local file, Google Sheets, or Google Drive. If you first
sort the query results by column, then the order is preserved in the downloaded
data. Saving results to a local file, Google Sheets, or Google Drive is not
supported by the bq command-line tool or the API.
Limitations
Downloading and saving query results are subject to the following limitations:
You can download query results locally only in CSV or newline-delimited JSON
format.
You cannot save query results containing nested and repeated data to
Google Sheets.
To save query results to Google Drive using the Google Cloud console, the
results set must be 1 GB or less. If your results are larger, you can save
them to a table instead.
When saving query results to a local CSV file, the maximum download size is
10 MB.
The maximum download size is based on the size of each row returned in the
tabledata.list
method
response, and can vary based on the schema of the query results. As a result,
the size of the downloaded CSV file can vary, and might be less than the
maximum download size limit.
