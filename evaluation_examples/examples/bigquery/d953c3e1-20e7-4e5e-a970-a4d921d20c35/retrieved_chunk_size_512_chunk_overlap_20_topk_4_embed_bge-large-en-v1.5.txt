Example 3
Prompt 1
Find data about USA names
Potential result
BigQuery data canvas generates a list of tables. For this example, we are going to
select the
bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_current
table.
Click
Query
to query the data. Enter a prompt to query the data.
Potential result
BigQuery data canvas generates the following query:
SELECT
  state,
  gender,
  year,
  name,
  number
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_current`
BigQuery data canvas generates the results of the query. We are going to ask an
additional query to filter this data. Click
Query these results
.
Prompt 2
Get me the top 10 most popular names in 1980
Potential result
BigQuery data canvas generates the following query:
SELECT
  name,
  SUM(number) AS total_count
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data`.usa_names.usa_1910_current
WHERE
  year = 1980
GROUP BY
  name
ORDER BY
  total_count DESC
LIMIT
  10;
After running the query, we get a table with the ten most common names of
children born in 1980.
For this example, we are going to visualize these results. Click
Visualize
.
BigQuery data canvas suggests several visualization options, including bar chart, pie
chart, line graph, and custom visualization. Click
Create bar chart
.
BigQuery data canvas creates a bar chart similar to the following:
Along with providing a chart, BigQuery data canvas summarizes some of the key details
of the data backing the visualization. You can modify the chart by clicking
Visualization details
and editing your chart in the side panel.
Prompt 3
Create a bar chart sorted high to low, with a gradient
Potential result
BigQuery data canvas creates a bar chart similar to the following:
To make further changes, click
Visualization details
. The Vis details
sidebar is displayed. You can edit the chart title, x-axis name, y-axis name,
and more.

Documentation Title:
Run a query  |  BigQuery  |  Google Cloud

Documentation Content:
In the query editor, enter a valid GoogleSQL query.
For example, query the
BigQuery public dataset
usa_names
to determine the most common names in the United States between the
years 1910 and 2013:
SELECT
  name, gender,
  SUM(number) AS total
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_2013`
GROUP BY
  name, gender
ORDER BY
  total DESC
LIMIT
  10;
Optional: Specify the destination table and
location
for the query results:
In the query editor, click
settings
More
, and then
click
Query settings
.
In the
Destination
section, select
Set a destination table for query results
.
For
Dataset
, enter the name of an existing dataset for the
destination table—for example,
myProject.myDataset
.
For
Table Id
, enter a name for the destination table—for
example,
myTable
.
If the destination table is an existing table, then for
Destination table write preference
, select whether to append or
overwrite the table with the query results.
If the destination table is a new table, then
BigQuery creates the table when you run your query.
In the
Additional settings
section, click the
Data location
menu, and then select an option.
In this example, the
usa_names
dataset is stored in the US
multi-region location. If you specify a destination table for this
query, the dataset that contains the destination table must also be
in the US multi-region. You cannot query a dataset in one location
and write the results to a table in another location.
Click
Save
.
Click
play_circle
Run
.
If you don't specify a destination table, the query job writes the
output to a temporary (cache) table.
You can now explore the query results in the
Results
tab of the
Query results
pane.
Optional: To sort the query results by column, click
arrow_drop_down
Open sort menu
next to the column name and select a sort order. If the estimated bytes
processed for the sort is more than zero, then the number of bytes is
displayed at the top of the menu.
