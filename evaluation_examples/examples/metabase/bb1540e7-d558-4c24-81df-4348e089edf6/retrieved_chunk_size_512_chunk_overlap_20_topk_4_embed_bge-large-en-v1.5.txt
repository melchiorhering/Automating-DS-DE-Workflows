Documentation Title:
Visualizing data

Documentation Content:
Maps
When you select the
Map
visualization, Metabase will automatically try and pick the best kind of map to use based on the table or result set.
Formatting data in charts
While we’re talking about formatting, we thought you should also know that you can access formatting options for the columns used in a chart. Just open the visualization settings and select the
Data
tab:
Then click on the gear icon next to the column that you want to format. Dates, numbers, and currencies tend to have the most useful formatting options.
