Documentation Title:
The SQL editor

Documentation Content:
It will create a new Query Builder question that uses the SQL question results as a data source.
To enable drill-through, turn a SQL question into a model and set the data types
Visualizations created with SQL do not have
drill-through
capability. To enable drill-through on a SQL question, you can turn it into a model:
Save the SQL question and
turn it into a model
.
Edit the column metadata
in the model’s settings. Make sure to set the data types for all the columns.
Create a Query Builder question
based on the model. You should be able to use drill-through on this question, if you configured the metadata correctly.

Documentation Title:
A tour of Metabase

Documentation Content:
Plus, people who don’t know SQL can duplicate your question and use it as a starting point for another question.
Query builder questions automatically get a drill-through menu applied to their visualizations, allowing people to click on a table or chart to
drill through the data
.
Questions asked with the query builder can start with a
model
, a raw table, or with the results of a saved question, and you can convert them to native SQL at any time.
Native queries
Use the
native query editor
to compose questions in the database’s native query languages (typically SQL for relational databases, but also other query languages for data sources like MongoDB). For questions written in SQL, you can use variables in your code to create
SQL templates
, including
field filter
variables that can create smart dropdown filters.
Like query builder questions, you can use the results of models or
saved questions
as starting points for new questions, just as you would a table or view. For example, to reference question 123 like so:
WITH
gizmo_orders
AS
#
{
123
}
Create models to use as starting data for new questions
Models
are built with questions from either the query builder or the SQL editor. You can use them to pull together data from multiple tables, with custom, calculated columns, and column descriptions and other metadata, to create great starting data for people to ask new questions. For example, you could build a model for “Active users”, or “Priority orders”, or however you want to model your business.
If you find that you’re using the same saved question over and over as your starting data for new questions, you may want to convert that saved question to a model, which will let you add metadata like column descriptions and column types. You can also refer to models in SQL queries, just like we did above with saved questions.
Upload spreadsheets
You can
upload CSVs
to query and visualize in Metabase. This feature is handy for quick ad hoc analysis of spreadsheet data.
Visualize results
When you ask a question, Metabase will guess at the most appropriate visualization type for the results, but you can select from sixteen different visualization options.
Additionally, each visualization type has their own set of options to customize.

Data Modeling
Data modeling overview
Metabase provides tools for organizing your data and making it easier for people to understand.
Models
Models curate data from another table or tables from the same database to anticipate the kinds of questions people will ask of the data. You can think of them as derived tables, or a special kind of saved question meant to be used as the starting point for new questions.
Table metadata admin settings
Guide people to the right data by adding display names, hiding outdated tables, configuring filter types, and more.
Field types
Field types dictate how Metabase displays its data, as well as the column’s special functionality, if any.
Setting default formatting for your data
Define formatting and display defaults for numbers, currencies, datetimes, and more.
Working with JSON
Metabase can unfold JSON columns into their component fields, which you can then filter on using the query builder.
Creating segments and metrics
Admins can define segments to create official filters for your data, and metrics for official aggregations.

Documentation Title:
Models

Documentation Content:
Create a model
First, search for models that already exist. If you can’t find one that meets your needs, you can create a model:
from scratch
, or
from a saved question
.
Models you create are automatically
pinned to the current collection
.
Create a model from scratch
In the upper right, click
New +
>
Model
.
Choose either the query builder or a native query (if you want to use SQL). The advantage of using the query builder is that Metabase will be able to fill out some of the metadata for you; if you use SQL, you’ll have to fill out that metadata manually.
Select your data.
Create and save your query.
Create a model from a saved question
Ask a question
using either the query builder or the SQL editor, or select an existing saved question that you want to convert to a model.
Save the question.
Click on the
…
>
Turn this into a model
.
Model detail page
To view a model’s detail page:
From a collection: click on the
book
icon next to a model.
From a model: click on the
info
button in the upper right, then click
Model details
.
Here you’ll see several tabs:
Used by
: lists the items based on the model.
Schema
: lists the fields in the model.
Actions
: lists the actions in the model, and allows you to create new
actions
.
The model detail page also shows some basic info about the model:
Description
Contact (who wrote the model)
Backing table(s)
To start a new question based on the model, click
Explore
.
To edit the model’s underlying query, click
Edit definition
.
You can also edit the model’s metadata.
Add metadata to columns in a model
Metadata is the secret sauce of models. When you write a SQL query, Metabase can display the results, but it can’t “know” what kind of data it’s returning (like it can with questions built using the query builder). What this means in practice is that people won’t be able to drill-through the results, or explore the results with the query builder, because Metabase doesn’t understand what the results are.
