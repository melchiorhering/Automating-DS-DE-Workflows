Models curate data from another table or tables from the same database to anticipate the kinds of questions people will ask of the data. You can think of them as derived tables, or a special kind of saved question meant to be used as the starting point for new questions.

Documentation Title:
Models in Metabase

Documentation Content:
If, however, we manually set the type for each result column in the model’s metadata, Metabase will then be able to present the drill-through menu on charts, as well as know which kind of filters it should use for that column (e.g., filters for numbers will have different options than for dates or categories).</p><h2>Models can surface individual records in search</h2><p>Another neat metadata feature with models: you can opt to <a>index values from a model</a>so that they show up in Metabase’s search results.</p><p>Here we’re toggling on the option to <strong>Surface individual records in search by matching against this column</strong>(bottom right):</p><p>For example, you could index a column in a model with customer names so people can type in a customer like Hudson Borer and jump straight to the detail view for that customer.</p><p>By indexing records in a model, you can also X-ray them. See the <a>docs on models for more details</a>.</p><h2>Skip the SQL variables</h2><p>Here is a subtle point worth calling out. If you’re used to creating “models” with saved questions and SQL variables (like <a>field filters</a>) so that people can take those questions and connect them to dashboard filters, models take a different approach here. Models don’t work with variables, because they don’t need to. Once you tell Metabase the model’s column types, you can start a question from that model, save it, and be able to wire it up to a dashboard filter. There’s no need to put a variable in your SQL code.</p><p>If you add a model to a dashboard, you’ll notice that you can’t map any of its columns to a dashboard filter, even after you’ve set the types for those filters.
