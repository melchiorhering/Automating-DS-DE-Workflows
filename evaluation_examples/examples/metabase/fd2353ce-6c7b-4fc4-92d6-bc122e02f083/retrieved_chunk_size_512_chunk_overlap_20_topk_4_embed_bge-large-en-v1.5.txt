API keys
Metabase can create API keys to authenticate programmatic requests to the API. To set the permissions for an API key, you can assign the key to a
group
.
Fair warning about Metabase’s API
We don’t version the
Metabase API
. We rarely change API endpoints, and almost never remove them, but if you write code that relies on the API, there’s a chance you might have to update your code in the future.
That said, there are times when it’s nice to work with the API, like when managing permissions with a large number of people and groups, or bulk archiving, or content creation. So we added the ability to create API keys to authenticate your programmatic requests.
Create an API key
To create an API key:
Click on the
gear
icon in the upper right.
Select
Admin settings
.
Go to the
Settings
tab.
Click on the
Authentication
tab on the left menu.
Scroll to
API Keys
and click
Manage
.
Click the
Create API Key
button.
Enter a
Key name
. You can have multiple API keys, so give it a name that will help you remember what you’re using the key for.
Select a
Group
. The key will have the same permissions granted to that group.
Click
Create
.
Copy the generated API key and save it somewhere safe. Metabase won’t be able to show you the key again. If you lose the key, you’ll need to regenerate a new key.
Managing API Keys
To view and manage existing API keys:
Click on the
gear
icon in the upper right.
Select
Admin settings
.
Go to the
Settings
tab.
Click on the
Authentication
tab on the left menu.

Documentation Content:
Warning: the Metabase API can change
The API is subject to change
. We rarely change API endpoints, and almost never remove them, but if you write code that relies on the API, there’s a chance you might have to update your code in the future.
The API isn’t versioned
. So don’t expect to stay on a particular version of Metabase in order to use a “stable” API.
For API changes, check out the Developer guide’s
API changelog
.
Getting started with the Metabase API
To keep things simple, we’ll use the venerable command line utility
curl
for our API call examples; you could also consider a dedicated tool for developing API requests (like
Postman
). To follow along, you can
spin up a fresh Metabase on localhost
and play around.
Create an API key
To use the API, create an
API key
.
Example GET request
Here’s an example API request that hits the
/api/permissions/group
endpoint, which returns the permission groups you have set up in your Metabase. Replace
YOUR_API_KEY
with your API key:
curl
\
-H
'x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY'
\
-X
GET
'http://localhost:3000/api/permissions/group'
The above request returns an array of JSON objects for the groups in your Metabase (formatted for readability):
[
{
"id"
:
2
,
"name"
:
"Administrators"
,
"member_count"
:
2
},
{
"id"
:
1
,
"name"
:
"All Users"
,
"member_count"
:
3
}
]
Example POST request
You can also use a file to store the JSON payload for a POST request. This makes it easy to have a pre-defined set of requests you want to make to the API.
