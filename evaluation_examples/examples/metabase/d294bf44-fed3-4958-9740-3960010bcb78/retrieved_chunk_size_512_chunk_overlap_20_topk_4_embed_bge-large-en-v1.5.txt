Documentation Title:
Running Metabase on Docker

Documentation Content:
and we are mounting that folder from our local filesystem into the container.
Getting your config back if you stopped your container
If you’ve previously run and configured your Metabase using the local Database and then stopped the container, your data will still be there unless you deleted the container with the
docker rm
command. To recover your previous configuration:
1. Find the stopped container using the
docker ps -a
command. It will look something like this:
docker ps -a | grep metabase
    ca072cd44a49        metabase/metabase        "/app/run_metabase.sh"   About an hour ago   Up About an hour          0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp   metabase
    02e4dff057d2        262aa3d0f714             "/app/run_metabase.sh"   23 hours ago        Exited (0) 23 hours ago                            pedantic_hypatia
    0d2170d4aa4a        262aa3d0f714             "/app/run_metabase.sh"   23 hours ago        Exited (0) 23 hours ago                            stoic_lumiere
Once you have identified the stopped container with your configuration in it, save the container ID from the left most column for the next step.
2. Use
docker commit
to create a new custom docker image from the stopped container containing your configuration.
docker commit ca072cd44a49 mycompany/metabase-custom
sha256:9ff56186de4dd0b9bb2a37c977c3a4c9358647cde60a16f11f4c05bded1fe77a
3. Run your new image using
docker run
to get up and running again.
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name metabase mycompany/metabase-custom
430bb02a37bb2471176e54ca323d0940c4e0ee210c3ab04262cb6576fe4ded6d
You should have your previously configured Metabase Installation back.

Documentation Title:
Setting up Metabase

Documentation Content:
We won’t be able to connect to your database without it, but you’d like to deal with all of this later, that’s okay: just click
I’ll add my data later
. Metabase comes with a
Sample Database
that you can play around with to get a feel for how Metabase works.
If you’re ready to connect, here’s what you’ll need:
The
hostname
of the server where your database lives
The
port
the database server uses
The
database name
The
username
you use for the database
The
password
you use for the database
If you don’t have this information handy, the person responsible for administering the database should have it.
Connect to your database
Now that you have your database info you can connect to your database. Sweet, sweet data at last. Just go ahead and put your info into this form and click
Next
.
For more on connecting to databases, see
Adding and managing databases
.
Usage data preferences
One last quick thing that you’ll have to decide is if it’s okay for us to collect some anonymous info about how you use the product — it helps us make Metabase better. Like the box says:
Metabase never collects anything about your data or question results.
All collection is completely anonymous.
Collection can be turned off at any point in your admin settings.
If you’re ready to start using Metabase, go ahead and click
Next
.
Staying in touch
At this point you are all set and ready to use Metabase. Since we like keeping in touch with our friends we made it easy to sign up for our newsletter (infrequent emails) with a single click!
Once you’re done here simply follow the link to
Take me to Metabase
. And if you decided to skip the newsletter sign-up, it’s cool, we still like you :)

Troubleshooting Guide
People can’t log in to Metabase
No access to Metabase login page
If you’re not a Metabase admin, you’ll have to tag them for help here.
Check that you have the correct
site URL
from
Settings
>
Admin settings
>
General
.
Check if the
account is deactivated
.
No access to Metabase Cloud account
The admin password for
store.metabase.com
(where you can find payment and subscription info) is not necessarily the same as the password for your Metabase instance (where you log in to look at data).
If you’ve forgotten your Metabase Cloud admin password, you can
contact support
to reset the password.
