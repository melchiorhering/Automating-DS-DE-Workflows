Confirm your password: Spider2.0
4. Upon completion, click "Next";
5. For the usage, choose any of the options, e.g., "Not sure yet";
6. Next step is to add your data, click the icon "PostgreSQL";
7. And fill all fields according to setup.json into this form, concretely:
Display name: PostgresData
Host: localhost
Port: 5432
Database name: metabase

8. After completion, scroll down and click button "Connect database";
9. Since the user do not want to share data, for Usage data preferences, disable Metabase to collect usage events.
10. Click "Finish" button to next step;
11. Directly click "Take me to Metabase" to complete the entire setup.
