Contributing to Metabase

Documentation Content:
Working on features
Some features, eg Database drivers, don’t have any user facing pixels. These are a great place to start off contributing as they don’t require as much communication, discussions about tradeoffs and process in general.
In situations where a design has already been done, we can always use some help. Chime in on a pull request or an issue and offer to help.
Generally speaking, any issue in
Help Wanted
is fair game.
#YOLO JUST SUBMIT A PR
If you come up with something really cool, and want to share it with us, just submit a PR. If it hasn’t gone through the above process, we probably won’t merge it as is, but if it’s compelling, we’re more than willing to help you via code review, design review and generally OCD nitpicking so that it fits into the rest of our codebase.
