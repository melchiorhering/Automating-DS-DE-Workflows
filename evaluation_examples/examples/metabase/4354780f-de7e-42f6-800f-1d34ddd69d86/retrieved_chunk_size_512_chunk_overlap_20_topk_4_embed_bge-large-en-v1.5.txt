We’ll show examples both in the query builder and the sql editor:

The Sample Database doesn’t contain events; it’s just four tables with order, product, and customer information. So we’ll have to get a little creative here to come up with examples for funnel charts.
Funnel chart example using the query builder
Here’s a contrived example. We’re going to pretend that the steps in our funnel are product categories (because we don’t have anything like statuses or pages or other progressions in our Sample Database). Here’s the
notebook view
of our query:
What we’ve done is joined the
Orders
and
Products
tables (see
Joins in Metabase
), summarized the count of orders, and grouped those counts by product category. Then we’ve sorted the results by count, descending. To get a funnel chart, we clicked on
Visualization
in the bottom left, and selected
Funnel
. In the settings of a funnel chart, under the
Data
tab, you can set the
Step
(in this case we’re using the product category) and the
Measure
(the count of orders).
Notice that in the
Settings -> Display
tab, you can change the
Funnel type
to “Bar chart”, which is another valid way of representing the data. The advantage of a funnel chart (beyond the visual metaphor) is that Metabase will also show the percentage of the measure that made it through each step.
Keeping the steps sorted with a custom column
If the count in each step doesn’t naturally decrease, you may need to sort the steps manually to preserve the actual progression of steps. For example, if you have the same count in successive steps, the steps could get swapped in the funnel chart, like if Metabase defaults to sorting the steps alphabetically to break the tie. Likewise if you have funnels that can expand in count at certain steps (new people entering the funnel halfway through, for example) the funnel will default to descending counts, which will mess up your step order.
In these cases, you can create an additional column to number the steps, and sort by step to enforce the correct funnel sequence.

The table will have two columns:
-- the Step: number of categories (our step),
-- and the count of customers (our measure).
SELECT
'Ordered from one category'
AS
"Step: number of categories"
,
Count
(
*
)
AS
Customers
FROM
cat_one
UNION
SELECT
'Ordered from two categories'
AS
"Step: number of categories"
,
Count
(
*
)
AS
Customers
FROM
cat_two
UNION
SELECT
'Ordered from three categories'
AS
"Step: number of categories"
,
Count
(
*
)
AS
Customers
FROM
cat_three
UNION
SELECT
'Ordered from four categories'
AS
"Step: number of categories"
,
Count
(
*
)
AS
Customers
FROM
cat_four
ORDER
BY
customers
DESC
Which should yield:
| Step: number of categories    | CUSTOMERS |
|-------------------------------|-----------|
| Ordered from one category     | 1,746     |
| Ordered from two categories   | 1,632     |
| Ordered from three categories | 1,428     |
| Ordered from four categories  | 1,031     |
Now all we have to do is click on
Visualization
in the bottom left and select
Funnel
.
If you open up the
Settings
tab, you can change up the
Step
or the
Measure
. In the
Display
tab, you can change the chart from a funnel to a bar chart (though as mentioned above, you’ll lose both the visual metaphor and the measure’s percentage with respect to the first step).

How to create a line chart
Let’s take a look at the
Orders
table in the
Sample Database
that ships with Metabase. From the main navigation bar, click on
+ New
>
Question
, which will take you to Metabase’s query builder. Choose
Raw Data
>
Sample Database
, then pick the
Orders
table. Click
Visualize
, then click the
Visualization button
in the bottom right to bring up the
Visualization sidebar
.
Let’s start with how
not
to create a line chart. If you select
line chart
, Metabase will present you with an empty line chart.
Metabase can’t read minds (yet), so it doesn’t know which columns from the
Orders
table to use for the x and y axes. To create a line chart, you’ll need to pick a metric for Metabase to plot over time. For example, you could show order totals over time by setting the x axis to
created_at
and the y axis to
total
. Metabase will automatically plot the line chart:
That’s technically a line chart, but it looks more like the cardiograph of a startled hummingbird, and that’s even after Metabase has truncated the results shown. (If you hover over the gray warning triangle in the upper right, you’ll see that Metabase has only plotted 2,000 rows.)
To make the chart more legible, we can summarize the data, so each point on the line chart is an aggregate of rows—“buckets” of records. (It’s much more common to plot unaggregated rows in visualizations like
pin maps
, or a
scatterplot
, e.g., to show each product plotted by price and rating.)
As an example of an aggregated metric, let’s plot the sum of order totals for each month. Click on the green
Summarize button
to pull up the
Summarize sidebar
. Metabase defaults to counting the records, but we’re not interested in the number of orders, so we’ll click on
Count
and change it to
Sum of
and select the
Total
column from
Order
.
Next, we’ll want to group our order totals by month.
