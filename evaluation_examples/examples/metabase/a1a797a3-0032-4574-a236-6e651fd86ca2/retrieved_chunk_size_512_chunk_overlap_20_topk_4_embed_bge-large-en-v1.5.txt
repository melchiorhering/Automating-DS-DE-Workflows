Managing people and groups

Documentation Content:
If they log in using Google credentials, Metabase displays a Google icon.
If they log in using an email address and password stored in Metabase, no icon is shown.
Note that the type of user is set when the account is first created: if you create a user in Metabase, but that person then logs in via Google or some other form of SSO, the latter’s icon will
not
show up next to their name.
Resetting someone’s password
If you’ve already
configured your email settings
, people can reset their passwords using the “forgot password” link on the login screen. If you haven’t yet configured your email settings, they will see a message telling them to ask an admin to reset their password for them.
To reset a password for someone, just click the three dots icon next to their account and choose
Reset Password
. If you haven’t
configured your email settings
yet, you’ll be given a temporary password that you’ll have to share with that person. Otherwise, they’ll receive a password reset email.
Resetting the admin password
If you’re using Metabase Cloud,
contact support
to reset your admin password.
If you’re a Metabase admin and have access to the server console, you can get Metabase to send you a password reset token:
Stop the running Metabase application.
Restart Metabase with
reset-password email@example.com
, where “email@example.com” is the email associated with the admin account:
java -jar metabase.jar reset-password email@example.com
Metabase will print out a random token like this:
...
Resetting password for email@example.com...

OK [[[1_7db2b600-d538-4aeb-b4f7-0cf5b1970d89]]]
Start Metabase normally again (
without
the
reset-password
option).
Navigate to it in your browser using the path
/auth/reset_password/:token
, where “:token” is the token that was generated from the step above.

Account settings
You can view your account settings by going to the top right of the screen and clicking on the
gear
icon >
Account settings
.
Account profile
You can set your first and last names, change your email address, and set your language. See our list of
supported languages
.
Account password
You can change your password here. Note that if your Metabase uses Single Sign-On (SSO), your administrator will have disabled this password section, as your identity provider will manage logins.
If you’re having trouble logging in, see our
People can’t log into Metabase
.
Account login history
The login history lists each login, along with some location information (if available), and some client information (like Browser (Firefox/Windows)).
If you see any suspicious login attempts, change your password and notify your administrator.
A note about new login emails
Whenever you log in from a new device, Metabase will send you an email just to let you know someone (presumably you) has logged in from an unrecognized device. If you see this email, but don’t remember logging in, or don’t recognize the device, change your password and let your administrator know.
Disable animations in Metabase
This isn’t an in-Metabase setting, but just so you know: you can disable UI animations in Metabase (like sidebars sliding around, or rotating spinners) by changing the settings for your operating system so it respects the
prefers-reduced-motion
CSS media feature. This change will also affect other applications, not just Metabase. Check out the instructions for how to set the user preferences for your operating system in the
MDN Web Docs
.

Troubleshooting Guide
People can’t log in to Metabase
No access to Metabase login page
If you’re not a Metabase admin, you’ll have to tag them for help here.
Check that you have the correct
site URL
from
Settings
>
Admin settings
>
General
.
Check if the
account is deactivated
.
No access to Metabase Cloud account
The admin password for
store.metabase.com
(where you can find payment and subscription info) is not necessarily the same as the password for your Metabase instance (where you log in to look at data).
If you’ve forgotten your Metabase Cloud admin password, you can
contact support
to reset the password.

Managing people and groups

Documentation Content:
The full URL should look something like this:
https://metabase.example.com/auth/reset_password/1_7db2b600-d538-4aeb-b4f7-0cf5b1970d89
You should now see a page where you can input a new password for the admin account.
Unsubscribe from all subscriptions / alerts
This action will delete any dashboard subscriptions or alerts the person has created, and remove them as a recipient from any other subscriptions or alerts.
This action doesn’t affect email distribution lists that are managed outside of Metabase.
Default user accounts
Metabase includes default user accounts to handle various tasks. We’re documenting these accounts here so you know they’re legitimate accounts and not someone trying to spy on your Metabase. Some things to know about them:
Customers are not charged for these accounts.
No one can log in to these user accounts.
Metabase excludes these user accounts from the
Admin settings
>
People
tab.
Anonymous user account
ID: 0
First name: External
Last name: User
Email: null
Metabase uses this anonymous user account to identify anonymous views, for example views of a
public question or dashboard
. This account is a virtual user: the account doesn’t exist in the application database. You’ll see this account show up in
usage analytics
.
Metabase internal account
ID: 13371338
First name: Internal
Last name: Metabase
Email: internal@metabase.com
Metabase uses this account to load content into Metabase (like the
Metabase analytics
collection). You may see this
internal@metabase.com
account in the logs.
Groups
To determine
who has access to what
, you’ll need to
Create one or more groups.
Choose which level of access that group has to different databases, collections, and so on.
Then add people to those groups.
(Optional) promote people to
group managers
.
To view and manage your groups, go to the
Admin Panel
>
People
tab, and then click on
Groups
from the side menu.
Special default groups
Every Metabase has two default groups: Administrators and All Users. These are special groups that can’t be removed.
