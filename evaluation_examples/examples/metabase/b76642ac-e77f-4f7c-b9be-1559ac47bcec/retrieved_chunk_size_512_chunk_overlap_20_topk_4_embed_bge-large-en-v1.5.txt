Then we want to count the filtered rows.
In the
Filter
step, we’ll click the purple
Add filters to narrow your answer
button, and we’ll select
Subtotal
as the column to filter on. In the dropdown menu, change “Equal to” to “Greater than”, enter 40 in the input field, then click
Add filter
.
Previewing results
With each step, you can click on the triangle on the right to preview the results so far.
As expected, all of the subtotals are over $40 after the filter has been applied.
To close the preview, you can click on the
X
in the upper right of the preview.
Summarizing data
When we ask things like “how many,” “what’s the total,” “what’s the average,” etc., we’re talking about summarizing our data. That is, we’re talking about
metrics
. The metric in this case the number (or count) of orders after we’ve filtered for orders greater than $40. We’ll click the
Pick the metric you want to see
button in the
Summarize
step and select
Count of rows
.
When we click
Visualize
, Metabase will show us that there were 16,309 orders with a subtotal greater than $40. Said another way, there were 16,309 records in the
Orders
table that made it through our filter.
Grouping our results
That count is useful, but it would be even more useful if we knew
when
our customers placed these big orders—more specifically, if we knew how many greater-than-40 orders people placed each month.
We can return to the editor by hitting the back button, or by clicking on the
Editor
button in the upper right (the icon looks like a bulleted list). Alternatively, we can also click on the
Filter
and
Summarize
buttons to revise our question while staying on this page.
Since we want to group our results by month, we’ll click
Summarize
. If we open the
Summarize sidebar
, below where we picked our metric, there’s a list of all the columns that we can use to group our data together.

Build a record lookup tool with Metabase

Let’s try to find the total amount of money they’ve spent with us to date. Returning to the
Query Builder
, we’ll select
Summarize
, and select
Sum of
. Under the joined
Orders
table, we’ll select
Total
. And since we want to see the sum for each user, we’ll group by each user’s
ID
.
A preview shows us an updated table with just two columns:
ID
and our new column,
Sum of Orders → Total($)
. We’ll also sum the discounts (
Sum of Orders → Discount($)
), just like we did with the order totals.
Next, we’ll add the columns we want to include in our table by adding them to the
Group by
box of the
Summarize
section. Here’s our full list of columns:
ID
Email
Name
City
State
Zip
Created_at: Month
Sum of Orders → Total
Sum of Orders → Discount
With our notebook filled out, let’s click on the
Visualize button
, and Metabase will present us with our list.
So far so good, but let’s see if we can spruce it up a bit. Let’s change the formatting for our aggregate columns, which we can do by clicking on the heading for that column, then clicking on the
gears icon
.
We’ll change
Column title
to “Total money spent”, toggle
Show a mini bar chart
, and set
Where to display the unit of currency
to every cell.
The
mini bar chart
will show the cell’s value relative to the range of values in the column, which makes it easy to see how much money our customers spend compared with other customers.
We’ll do the same for the discount total column: add mini bar chart, rename heading, show currency in every cell.
We can also throw in some conditional formatting for the table as a whole. In the bottom left of our screen, we’ll click on the
Settings button
for the question, and Metabase will slide out the
Settings sidebar
. At the top of the sidebar, we’ll select the
Conditional formatting tab
.

The column we want to group by is
Created At
, because grouping by the orders’ creation date will give us separate counts of orders over $40 for each month, based on when each order was placed (or
Created_at
). We’ll select
Created At
, and Metabase immediately shows us a line chart of the orders over time. The default grouping for
Created_At
is by month, but if we wanted to group by date, week, year, or something else, we could do that by clicking
by month
next to
Created At
and selecting a different option from the dropdown.
We can keep tweaking our question using the sidebar, or return to our notebook by clicking on the
Editor
button. Here’s our updated question with the new summarize step:
Changing the visualization
Metabase can present the answers to questions in a variety of ways. To change the visualization, just select one of the options from the
Visualization sidebar
.
If we want to check the results as a table, we can click the little toggle at the bottom center of the page to toggle from our chart to the table of data and back again.
For other visualization options, click the blue
Visualization
button in the bottom left. For example, let’s visualize our question as an
area chart
.
Some visualizations aren’t the best way to show an answer to a question, so Metabase will fade out the option. For example, it wouldn’t make sense to show the total number of orders over $40 as a map.
If you want, you can try playing around with your question, like changing the number 40 to a different number. To do that, just click on the filter badge below the page title.

Getting started with Metabase

Documentation Content:
A navigation sidebar that lists:
Home
button to return to your Metabase home page.
Collections
, where you’ll store all of your questions, dashboards, and models. You have your own personal collection to store drafts and experiments that aren’t yet ready to share.
Data
section, which lists all of the data sources your Metabase is connected to.
Settings
(the
gear
icon in the upper right).
You can also
Bookmark
your favorite items, and they’ll appear toward the top of the navigation sidebar.
To open and close the navigation sidebar, click on the Metabase logo in the upper left.
Asking a new question
A
question
in Metabase is a query, the results of that query, and the visualization and formatting of those results (even if that visualization is just a
table
). Questions have titles, IDs, and unique URLs you can copy and share with others.
You can play around with a question by filtering and summarizing its results, save those explorations as new questions, and add questions to dashboards. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves; for the next few examples, we’ll be using the
Sample Database
that comes with Metabase.
Click on
+ New
in the main nav, and select
Question
. You can start a new question from:
A model
A raw table
A saved question
For now, let’s start from
Raw data
>
Sample database
>
Orders
. Metabase will open up the query builder.
Filtering data
The
Orders
table has a bunch of fake data in it about product orders from a made-up company. Let’s say we want to know:
How many orders have been placed with a subtotal (before tax) greater than $40?
More precisely, this question translates to: “How many records (or rows) are in the
Orders
table that have a value greater than 40 in the
Subtotal
column?”
To find out, we want to filter the data by the field we’re interested in, which in this case is the
Subtotal
. Then we want to count the filtered rows.
