About Astro | Astronomer Documentation

Documentation Content:
Astronomer recommends that you create a dedicated Git repository for each Astro project. To run a DAG, you add the DAG to your Astro project and deploy your Astro project to Astro.</p><p>See <a>Run your first DAG with the Astro CLI</a>to create your first Astro project.</p><h3>Astro UI<a>​</a></h3><p>The Astro UI, hosted at <code>https://cloud.astronomer.io</code>, is the primary interface for accessing and managing Astro from your web browser. You can use the Astro UI to:</p><ul><li>Manage users, teams, and permissions.</li><li>Create and configure Deployments, including infrastructure resources and compute.</li><li>View all of your organization's Deployments, DAGs, and tasks in a single place.</li><li>Monitor the health of your Airflow environments with a variety of alerts, logs, and analytics interfaces.</li><li>Stay up to date with the latest Astro features.</li><li>Create and edit DAGs in the Astro Cloud IDE.</li></ul><h3>Deployment<a>​</a></h3><p>An Astro <em>Deployment</em>is an Airflow environment hosted on Astro. It encompasses all core Airflow components, including the Airflow webserver, scheduler, and workers, along with additional tools for reliability and observability. It runs in an isolated Kubernetes namespace in an <a>Astro cluster</a>and has a set of attached resources to run your Airflow tasks.</p><p>Compared to an open source Airflow environment, an Astro Deployment is easy to create, delete, and modify through either the Astro UI or with the Astro CLI. You can <a>fine-tune resources and settings</a>directly from the Astro UI, see metrics and analytics for your DAGs, review your deploy history, and more. The infrastructure required to run a Deployment is managed by Astronomer.</p><p>To run DAGs in a Deployment, you must either deploy an Astro project manually from your local machine or configure an automated deploy process using a third-party CI/CD tool with the Astro CLI. Then, you can open the Airflow UI from the Astro UI and view your DAGs.

Debug DAGs | Astronomer Documentation

Documentation Content:
If the DAG appears in the list but not in the UI, try restarting the Airflow webserver.</p><p>Try restarting the Airflow scheduler with <code>astro dev restart</code>.</p><p>If you see an error in the Airflow UI indicating that the scheduler is not running, check the scheduler logs to see if an error in a DAG file is causing the scheduler to crash. If you are using the Astro CLI, run <code>astro dev logs -s</code>and then try restarting.</p></ul><p>At the code level, ensure that each DAG:</p><ul><li>Has a unique <code>dag_id</code>.</li><li>Contains either the word <code>airflow</code>or the word <code>dag</code>. The scheduler only parses files fulfilling this condition.</li><li>Is called when defined with the <code>@dag</code>decorator. See also <a>Introduction to Airflow decorators</a>.</li></ul><h3>Import errors due to dependency conflicts<a>​</a></h3><p>A frequent cause of DAG import errors is not having the necessary packages installed in your Airflow environment. You might be missing <a>provider packages</a>that are required for using specific operators or hooks, or you might be missing Python packages used in Airflow tasks.</p><p>In an Astro project, you can install OS-level packages by adding them to your <code>packages.txt</code>file. You can install Python-level packages, such as provider packages, by adding them to your <code>requirements.txt</code>file. If you need to install packages using a specific package manager, consider doing so by adding a bash command to your Dockerfile.</p><p>To prevent compatibility issues when new packages are released, Astronomer recommends pinning a package version to your project. For example, adding <code>astronomer-providers[all]==1.14.0</code>to your <code>requirements.txt</code>file ensures that no future releases of <code>astronomer-providers</code>causes compatibility issues.
