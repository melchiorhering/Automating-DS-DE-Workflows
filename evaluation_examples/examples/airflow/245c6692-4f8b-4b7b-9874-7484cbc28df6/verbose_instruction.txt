I am using Astronomer to deploy Airflow
To create document for task, we can follow the steps:
1. Click the VS Code editor on the left panel or dock;
2. According to the opened README.md file, we can extract the instructions on completing the dag file;
3. Switch to the dag file ‘task_today.py’ that is opened in VSCode;
4. We'll now define the document to be applied on the task:
ˋˋˋ
# ... Keep the original ˋtask_todayˋ codes, the code should be written above class dag
doc_md_doc = """

### Purpose of this task

This task **boldly** suggests a daily activity to occupy my time.

Weather today: https://wttr.in/HongKong

If I don't like the suggested activity I can always play some games instead.

Check steam for my game: https://store.steampowered.com/

Sports today: running
gear: |
    - running shoes
    - sports clothes
    - a healthy lung
I hate running

But I can watch some anime when running: https://www.bilibili.com/
"""
ˋˋˋ
5. Then, we'll apply the doc defined in the @dag filed of dag:
ˋˋˋ
@dag(
    start_date=datetime(2024,4,1),
    schedule="@daily",
    catchup=False,
)
ˋˋˋ
6. Save the file content and click the Chromium on the left panel to switch to the opened airflow web page;
7. On the Airflow web page, find "task_today" in the DAG list and click the slider to the left of the name to Unpause dag; 
8. Click the triangle under the Action column on the far right of the row to trigger the dag; 
9. Wait until the status of all tasks in the 'Runs' column to change to "success" or "failed"
