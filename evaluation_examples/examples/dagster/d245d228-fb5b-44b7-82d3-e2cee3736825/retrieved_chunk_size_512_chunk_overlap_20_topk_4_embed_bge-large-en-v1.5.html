For faster development, you can either:</p><ol><p>Keep a warm kind cluster</p><p>Use a remote K8s cluster, e.g. via AWS EKS or GCP GKE</p></ol><p>Instructions are below.</p><section><h4>Faster local development (with kind)<a>Â¶</a></h4><p>You may find that the kind cluster creation, image loading, and kind cluster creation loop
is too slow for effective local dev.</p><p>You may bypass cluster creation and image loading in the following way. First add the <span>--no-cleanup</span>flag to your pytest invocation:</p><pre>pytest--no-cleanup-s-vvv-m<span>"not integration"</span></pre><p>The tests will run as before, but the kind cluster will be left running after the tests are completed.</p><p>For subsequent test runs, you can run:</p><pre>pytest--kind-cluster<span>=</span><span>"cluster-d9971c84d44d47f382a2928c8c161faa"</span>--existing-helm-namespace<span>=</span><span>"dagster-test-95590a"</span>-s-vvv-m<span>"not integration"</span></pre><p>This will bypass cluster creation, image loading, and Helm chart installation, for much faster tests.</p><p>The kind cluster name and Helm namespace for this command can be found in the logs, or retrieved
via the respective CLIs, using <code><span>kind</span><span>get</span><span>clusters</span></code>and <code><span>kubectl</span><span>get</span><span>namespaces</span></code>.
