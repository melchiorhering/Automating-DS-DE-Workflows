Due to the requirements of my team, I want you to help me migrate an Airbyte connection to Dagster. The steps are as follows:
1. Open Chromium. You can see the connections page in the Airbyte UI.
2. Click "MySQL â†’ Local JSON" from the connections list, and the details of the connection will be shown.
3. The address of the website is updated to "http://localhost:8000/workspaces/{workspace_id}/connections/{connection_id}/status". Select the connection UUID between "connections" and "status" in the address bar on the top. Press Ctrl+C to copy.
4. Switch to VS Code. The file "dagster_migration.py" is opened for you.
5. Add the following code to "dagster_migration.py", and remember to replace "{airbyte_connection_id}" with the connection UUID you just copied:
```
from dagster import job
from dagster_airbyte import airbyte_resource, airbyte_sync_op

my_airbyte_resource = airbyte_resource.configured(
    {
        "host": "localhost",
        "port": "8000",
    }
)
mysql_to_json = airbyte_sync_op.configured({"connection_id": "{airbyte_connection_id}"}, name="mysql_to_json")

@job(resource_defs={"airbyte": my_airbyte_resource})
def airbyte_job():
    mysql_to_json()
```
6. Press Ctrl+S to save the file.
7. Open the terminal. Make sure the current folder is "~/airflow-mysql-to-json".
8. Use the command "dagster dev -f dagster_migration.py" to start Dagster UI.
9. Wait a few seconds, and you will see the info "Serving dagster-webserver on http://127.0.0.1:3000 in process ...". Right click on the link "http://127.0.0.1:3000".
10. In the opened right click menu, select "Open Link". A new tab will open on Chromium.
11. Select "Launchpad" under the title "airbyte_job" on the top.
12. Click "Launch Run" on the bottom right. Wait for the run to succeed.
