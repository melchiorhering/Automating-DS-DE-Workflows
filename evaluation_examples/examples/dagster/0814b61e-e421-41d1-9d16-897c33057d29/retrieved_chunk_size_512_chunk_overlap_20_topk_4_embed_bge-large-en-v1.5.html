Tutorial, part three: Writing your first asset | Dagster Docs

Documentation Content:
As more assets are built, this graph will show your entire data platform in one place. This page can also be referred to as the <strong>Global Asset Lineage</strong>.</p><p>Observe that Dagster has detected your <code>topstory_ids</code>asset, but it says that the asset has never been <em>“materialized”</em>.</p><h2>Step 2: Materialize your asset<span>#</span></h2><p>To <strong>materialize</strong>a Software-defined asset means to create or update it. Dagster materializes assets by executing the asset's function or triggering an integration.</p><p>To manually materialize an asset in the UI, click the <strong>Materialize</strong>button in the upper right corner of the screen. This will create a Dagster run that will materialize your assets.</p><p>To follow the progress of the materialization and monitor the logs, each run has a dedicated page. To find the page:</p><ol><p>Click on the <strong>Runs</strong>tab in the upper navigation bar</p><p>Click the value in the <strong>Run ID</strong>column on the table of the Runs page</p><p>The top section displays the progress, and the bottom section live updates with the logs</p></ol><h2>Next steps<span>#</span></h2><p>You've written the first step in your data pipeline! In <a>the next section</a>, you'll learn how to add more assets to your pipeline.

You can also click on individual assets to collect a subset to materialize.</li></ul><h2>Building jobs that materialize assets<span>#</span></h2><p>Jobs that target assets can materialize a fixed selection of assets each time they run and be placed on schedules and sensors. Refer to the <a>Asset jobs documentation</a>for more info and examples.</p><h2>Grouping assets<span>#</span></h2><p>To help keep your assets tidy, you can organize them into groups. Grouping assets by project, concept, and so on simplifies <a>keeping track of them in the UI</a>.

Documentation Title:
Auto-Materializing Assets | Dagster

Documentation Content:
This enables a declarative approach to asset scheduling – instead of defining imperative workflows to materialize your assets, you just describe the conditions under which they should be materialized.</p><p>At a high-level, the most common way for assets to be auto-materialized is "eagerly" -- immediately after upstream changes occur, a run will be kicked off to incorporate those changes into a given asset. However, the precise rules that govern when runs are kicked off can be customized on an asset-by-asset basis.</p><h2>Turning on auto-materializing<span>#</span></h2><p>To enable assets to be automatically materialized, you need to first flip a toggle in the Dagster UI.</p><ul><li>If you're using an open source Dagster deployment, you can get to this toggle by clicking "Deployment" in the top navigation pane and then clicking on the "Daemons" tab.</li><li>If you're using Dagster+, you can get to this toggle by clicking "Deployment" in the top navigation pane, then clicking on the "Agents" tab, then looking under "Cloud service statuses".</li></ul><h2>Auto-materialize policies<span>#</span></h2><p>You can set up an asset to be auto-materialized by assigning it an <code>AutoMaterializePolicy</code>. Each policy consists of a set of <code>AutoMaterializeRules</code>, each representing individual reasons that an asset should be materialized or not at a given point in time. If there's at least one rule determining that the asset should be materialized, and no rules determining that it should be skipped, a run will be launched to materialize that asset.</p><p>It is recommended to start with the built-in <code>AutoMaterializePolicy.eager</code>and further customize from there if necessary. This policy consists of all of the supported rules, other than <code>materialize_on_cron</code>and <code>skip_on_not_all_parents_updated</code>.

In this case, <code>topstory_ids</code>(the list of IDs) is a dependency of <code>topstories</code>(the CSV file).</p><p>In your browser, navigate back to Dagster's Global Asset Lineage (<code>localhost:3000/asset-groups</code>), and click on the <strong>Reload Definitions</strong>button on the top-right region of the page. This will tell Dagster to re-scan your code for new assets and other definitions without stopping Dagster. You can also use the Command + Option + R (Mac) or Control + Alt (Windows) + R keyboard shortcut to perform the same action.</p><p>After reloading your definitions, look at the asset graph to see the relationship between your assets.</p><h3>Logging during asset materialization<span>#</span></h3><p>In the code above, a <code>print</code>statement is used to show progress while fetching stories from the Hacker News API. Dagster has a built-in logger that extends past <code>print</code>and other Python logging methods. This logger shows exactly where logging happens in your Dagster project, such as which asset and step during a run the log came from.</p><p>Dagster's logger can be accessed through the <code>context</code>argument, which is available through any asset-decorated function if the first keyword argument in it is named <code>context</code>. The <code>context</code>argument contains the logger, information about the current run, and other Dagster-specific utilities.</p><p>The Dagster framework uses Python type hints, such as how the <code>context</code>argument is of type <code>AssetExecutionContext</code>. By annotating the <code>context</code>argument, most code editors will enable autocomplete for the methods available on the <code>context</code>object, such as <code>context.log.info</code>.</p><p>The code below replaces the <code>print</code>statement with the Dagster logger:</p><code><span>from</span>dagster <span>import</span>asset<span>,</span>AssetExecutionContext
