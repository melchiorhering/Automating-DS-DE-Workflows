Paste and run the following statement to alter the account so that the event table you created is the active one for the account.
ALTER
ACCOUNT
SET
EVENT_TABLE
=
tutorial_log_trace_db
.
public
.
tutorial_event_table
;
Copy
This statement sets the new event table as the table that Snowflake should use for storing log messages and trace data from handlers
in the current account. You can have only one active event table for an account.
In this section, you created an event table. In the next section, you’ll start emitting log messages that Snowflake stores in the table.
Emit Log Messages
¶
In this section, you’ll create a user-defined function (UDF) with Python handler code that emits log messages. As your code emits log
messages, Snowflake collects the message data and stores it in the event table you created.
Snowflake supports APIs to log messages from each supported handler language. For handlers you write in Python, you can use the
logging
module in Python’s standard library.
To create a UDF that emits log messages:
Paste and run the following statement to set the log level to
INFO
.
ALTER
SESSION
SET
LOG_LEVEL
=
INFO
;
Copy
This specifies the severity of log messages that Snowflake should capture as the UDF runs. In this case, the level permits all
messages ranging from informational (
INFO
) to the most severe (
FATAL
).
Paste and run the following statement to create a user-defined function.
CREATE
OR
REPLACE
FUNCTION
log_trace_data
()
RETURNS
VARCHAR
LANGUAGE
PYTHON
RUNTIME_VERSION
=

.

HANDLER
=
'run'
AS
$$
import
logging
logger
=
logging
.
getLogger
(
"tutorial_logger"
)
def
run
()
:
logger
.
info
(
"Logging from Python function."
)
return
"SUCCESS"
$$;
Copy
Highlighted lines in the code do the following:
Import the Python
logging
module so that the handler code can use it.
Create a logger, which exposes the interface your code will use to log messages.
Log a message at the
INFO
level.
Paste and run the following statement to execute the function you just created.

You’ll also begin using the ACCOUNTADMIN role, which
is required to execute some of the statements in this tutorial.
You’re creating a database in which you’ll later create the event table and the user-defined function. You can delete all of the objects
you create in the tutorial, including the database and warehouse, when you no longer need them.
To create a database and warehouse for use in the tutorial:
Sign in to Snowsight.
Switch to the ACCOUNTADMIN role
.
Open
Projects
»
Worksheets
.
Select
+
»
SQL Worksheet
.
Rename the new worksheet
to
Logging-tracing
tutorial
.
In the new worksheet, paste and run the following statement to create a database. The new database is just for this tutorial.
CREATE
OR
REPLACE
DATABASE
tutorial_log_trace_db
;
Copy
Paste and run the following statement to create a warehouse. The new warehouse is just for this tutorial.
CREATE
OR
REPLACE
WAREHOUSE
tutorial_log_trace_wh
WAREHOUSE_TYPE
=
STANDARD
WAREHOUSE_SIZE
=
XSMALL
;
Copy
In this section, you put in place the pieces you need for the tutorial. In the next section, you’ll create an event table for storing
log and trace data.
Create an Event Table
¶
In this section, you’ll create an event table. As your handler code emits log messages and trace data, Snowflake saves the emitted data in
event table rows. You can query the event table to analyze the data.
You must create an event table to collect log and trace data. An event table always uses the
predefined structure
defined by Snowflake.
Important
To complete this section, you’ll need to be able to use the ACCOUNTADMIN role, which is required when altering an account so that the new event
table is the account’s active event table.
To create the event table and make it the active event table for the account:
Paste and run the following statement to create an event table.
CREATE
OR
REPLACE
EVENT TABLE
tutorial_event_table
;
Copy
This table is where Snowflake stores log and trace data.

You finished! Nicely done.
In this tutorial, you got an end-to-end view of how you can emit and store log and trace data from handler code, then query the stored data.
Along the way, you:
Created an event table.
For information related to event tables, refer to the following:
For more detail on setting up an event table, refer to
Setting up an Event Table
.
For reference information about the columns that make up an event table, refer to
Event table columns
.
For more on things you can do with event tables, refer to
Working with Event Tables
.
Created a user-defined function (UDF)
that emitted log and trace data. For related information, refer to the following:
For an overview of logging support in Snowflake, refer to
Logging Messages from Functions and Procedures
. For specific about
logging with Python, refer to

Paste and run the following statement to execute the function you just created.
SELECT
log_trace_data
();
Copy
This produces the following output. In addition, as the function executed, it emitted a log message that Snowflake collected in the
event table.
--------------------
| LOG_TRACE_DATA() |
--------------------
| SUCCESS          |
--------------------
In this section, you emitted a log message from a UDF. In the next section, you’ll query the event table to retrieve data related to the message.
Query for Log Messages
¶
In this section, you’ll query the event table for log message data emitted by the UDF you ran in the previous section.
Note
It can take several seconds for log or trace data emitted by handler code to be recorded in the event table. If you don’t see
results immediately, try again in a few seconds.
Snowflake uses
predefined event table columns
to collect and store log and
trace data of the following kinds:
Data you emit from handler code
, such as log messages and trace event data.
You’ll find these in columns such as RECORD_TYPE, RECORD, RECORD_ATTRIBUTES, and others.
Data about the context
in which the log or trace data was emitted, such as the timestamp, name of the handler method from which the data
was emitted, and so on.
You’ll find this data in columns such as RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES, TIMESTAMP, and SCOPE.
To query the event table for log message data:
Paste and run the following statement to query the event table.
SELECT
TIMESTAMP
AS
time
,
RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES
[
'snow.executable.name'
]
as
executable
,
RECORD
[
'severity_text'
]
AS
severity
,
VALUE
AS
message
FROM
tutorial_log_trace_db
.
public
.
tutorial_event_table
WHERE
RECORD_TYPE
=
'LOG'
AND
SCOPE
[
'name'
]
=
'tutorial_logger'
;
Copy
Some columns contain structured data expressed as key-value pairs. In this query, you specify attribute keys within a column by using
bracket notation
such as
RECORD['severity_text']
.
