    "instruction": "I heard there are many free to download datasets on Snowflake marketplace. And I am really curious about worldwide addresses. Could you help me get one database about it? Name it `WORLDWIDE_ADDRESSES`.\nHere is a step-by-step tutorial from an expert instructing you how to complete it:\nIn this task, we want to add one database from an existing marketplace on Snowflake. In the opened Snowsight web page, we need to do this:\n1. Click the \"Data Products >> Marketplace\" menu on the left panel;\n2. Then, in the search bar at the top of the right panel, type in \"worldwide addresses\" and press Enter.\n3. In the results of filtered choices, choose and click the first item, which should be \"Worldwide Address Data\". This free dataset from the OpenAddresses project allows Snowflake customers to map lat/long information to address details.\n4. On the right panel in the directed new page, click the \"Get\" button under the prompt \"Free Unlimited access\".\n5. There will be a pop-up window. Click \"Options\" to expand more settings.\n6. Type in the desired database name \"WORLDWIDE_ADDRESSES\" to replace the original one.\n7. Click \"Get\", and wait for a few moment. We will see that the database is \"Ready to Use\".\nYou can exactly follow the detailed plan above or proactively tackle the task based on the real-time environment interaction by yourself.",
