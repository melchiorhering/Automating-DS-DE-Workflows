Managing data listings | Snowflake Documentation

Documentation Content:
For personalized listings, you can replicate data upon consumer’s request.
Make sure to allocate time to set up replication and understand costs involved.
To share data in a region, you must have an account in that region in order to replicate data. If you have more than one account, all accounts must belong to the same organization.
When you publish a listing in a remote region, you can either allow all accounts in your organization to fulfill listing requests or explicitly add individual accounts as providers. Only the listing owner can specify who can fulfill listing requests.
Cross region data sharing utilizes Snowflake data replication functionality, for more information, see
Sharing data securely across regions and cloud platforms
.
You do not need to replicate the data to each region until a consumer requests it.
For free listings, you have an option to pre-associate a share with the listing in a remote region. This will allow consumers to get the share instantly without submitting a request.
To see a list of shares attached to a listing in a remote region, you must log in to the remote account from which you attached the share to the listing.
Creating and publishing a data listing
¶
To create a free or personalized data listing:
In
Snowsight
, navigate to
Data Products
»

.
Select the
Share Data
drop-down list and select a data exchange.
In the
New Listing
dialog box, enter the listing title as it appears to the consumers and select the listing type. For more information about listing type, see
Types of Listings
.
Complete each of the sections for the new listing. You can save the draft at any time to finish it later. For a description of each section and related fields, see
Listings Capabilities Reference
.
For a free listing, to associate a share with the listing, when editing the
Data
section:
Note
Until a listing is published, it can only be associated with a share in the local/primary account. After the listing is published, it can be associated with a share in additional regions that you have selected.
Select
Select Data
.
If a secure share exists, navigate to the share and select it. If a share does not exist, navigate to the desired database and select the database objects you wish to add to the share.

Approving consumer requests for data listings in a remote region
¶
Note
For
personalized
listings, data is not automatically available in remote regions. The provider is responsible for replicating their data to each of these regions.
For
free
listings, you have an option to pre-associate a share with the listing in a remote region. This allows consumers to get the share instantly without submitting a request. You can also replicate data and attach a share to a listing after receiving a request from the first consumer in a region. Once the listing is attached to the share, all consumers in that region can access the share instantly.
You can specify whether a listing can be fulfilled by a select provider account(s) or by any account in the organization.
To approve a request for a data listing submitted by a consumer:
Note
If the consumer is in a different region, before attaching a share, you must set up replication of data to the account in each remote region. For more information, see
Sharing data securely across regions and cloud platforms
.
Navigate to
Data Products
»
Private Sharing
.
Select the
Requests
tab.
Select
Review
next to the listing name.
In the
Associate Secure Share
section, select an account where you wish to create the share.
Select the role that owns the share and the shared database objects (or has the necessary privileges on the database objects to be able to add them to a share).
select
Select Data
.
If a secure share exists, navigate to the share and select it. If a share does not exist, navigate to the desired database and select the database objects you wish to add to the share.
Note
If you do not see a share, it is either already attached to another listing, or has been previously shared with consumers.
Select
Done
.
(Optional) You can change the default name for the secure share.
Select
Fullfill Request
.
Tip
If you receive an error when fulfilling a request for a remote region, consider the following:
Has the remote account been added to the Marketplace as a provider?
Is the remote account part of the same organization as the account you published the listing from?
Did you create a new share using the ACCOUNTADMIN role?
