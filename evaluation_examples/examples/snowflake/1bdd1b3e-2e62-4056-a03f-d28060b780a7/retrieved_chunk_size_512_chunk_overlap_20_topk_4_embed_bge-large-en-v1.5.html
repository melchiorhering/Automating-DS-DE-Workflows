The wizard performs the same PUT and COPY operations that you would using SQL, but combines the two phases (staging files and loading data)
into a single operation and deleting all staged files after the load completes.</p><p>You can load data from files on your local machine or files already staged in an existing cloud storage location on Snowflake, Amazon S3,
Google Cloud Storage, or Microsoft Azure.</p><section><h3>Prerequisites for loading data<a>¶</a></h3><p>Before you start loading data using Classic Console, do the following:</p><ul><li><p>Identify the location your data files.
