Example: Read Files from a Stage with Python Worksheets
¶
Snowpark Python lets you read files from a stage and write the contents to a table or save them as a view in Snowflake.
In this example, the Python code reads the contents of a compressed CSV-formatted file containing employee data,
data_0_0_0.csv.gz
from the
db1.public.files
named stage and writes the contents to a table called
employees
.
Note
To run this code example, you must use a role that has:
The USAGE privilege on the stage, database, and schema used in the code.
The CREATE TABLE privilege on the database schema to which you want to add the table.

Select a database and schema that you want to add the table to.
Select a warehouse to use to run the worksheet. If you have a default warehouse for your user, it is pre-selected.
Make sure your warehouse is running.
Write the Snowpark Python code as part of the

function:

Getting started with worksheets | Snowflake Documentation

Documentation Content:
Select
+
and select
SQL Worksheet
or
Python Worksheet
to create a worksheet.
The worksheet opens in the same window with the date and time of creation as the default title.
You can then start writing in your worksheet. For a SQL worksheet,
start writing queries
.
For a Python worksheet,
start writing code
.
Create worksheets from a SQL file
¶
To create a SQL worksheet from an existing SQL file, do the following:
Sign in to Snowsight.
Select
Projects
»
Worksheets
to open the list of worksheets.
Select the
…
more menu »
Create Worksheet from SQL File
.
Browse to the SQL file to upload.
A new worksheet opens with a title that matches the file name.
You can also add a SQL file to an existing SQL worksheet. Refer to
Append a SQL script to an existing worksheet
.
Opening worksheets in tabs
¶
You can use tabs to refer to multiple active worksheets and explore the databases and schemas in Snowflake while writing SQL
statements or Python code in Snowsight. Your scroll position is preserved in each tab, making comparisons across worksheets easier
to perform. Worksheet tabs are preserved across sessions, so you can pick up your work where you left off.
To open your Snowsight worksheets in tabs, do the following:
Sign in to Snowsight.
Select
Projects
»
Worksheets
.
Select an existing worksheet, or select
+ Worksheet
to open a new worksheet. A worksheet opens in a tab.
Select a role to run the worksheet as, and select a warehouse to allocate the compute resources for your query.
In the
Worksheets
menu, select an existing worksheet or select
+
to open a new worksheet tab. By default, the new worksheet
uses your default role and warehouse.
(Optional) Make changes to the role or warehouse used to run the new worksheet.
After you open a worksheet, you can
update the contents
,
run SQL statements
or
write Python code
, and manage the worksheet.

Documentation Title:
Writing Snowpark Code in Python Worksheets | Snowflake Documentation

Documentation Content:
After running a Python worksheet, review the results and output returned by your script. The results display as a string, variant, or a
table, depending on your code. See
Running Python Worksheets
.
Note
Because Python worksheets run inside Snowflake rather than in your local development environment, you cannot use
session.add_import
to add a file that your Python code depends on, or
session.add_packages
or
session.add_requirements
to add packages that you need
to use in your Python code. Instead, you add those files to a stage and reference them in your code.
See
Staging files using Snowsight
.
Python worksheets have the following limitations:
Log levels lower than WARN do not appear in the
Output
for a Python worksheet by default. To log lower level messages to the output,
use a logging library such as the
logging
module to set the level of messages logged.
No support for breakpoints or running only portions of the Python code in a worksheet.
No support for images or webpages. Images or webpages generated by Python code cannot be displayed in Python worksheets.
Python worksheets use Python 3.11 by default, but you can choose another supported version in
Packages
.
If you require support for any of these options, consider using your local development environment instead.
See
Setting Up Your Development Environment for Snowpark Python
.
Prerequisites for Python Worksheets
¶
To use Python worksheets, you must do the following:
Review and accept the Anaconda Terms of Service in Snowsight. See
Review and accept the Anaconda Terms of Service
.
(Optional) Add Python files and packages that are not
included with Anaconda
that you want
to use in a Python worksheet to a named stage. See
Add a Python File from a Stage to a Worksheet
.
Choose a warehouse to use for Python worksheets. Snowflake recommends using an X-Small warehouse for development.
If you’re running a very large Snowpark workload, use a
Snowpark-optimized warehouse
.
See
Warehouse size
for additional details about warehouse sizes.
Review and accept the Anaconda Terms of Service
¶
Before you start using the packages provided by Anaconda inside Snowflake, you must acknowledge
the
External Offerings Terms
.

General Availability
¶
With this release, we are pleased to announce the general availability of Python worksheets in Snowsight. Python worksheets let
you write and run Snowpark Python code in a worksheet in Snowsight. You can now use Python version 3.11 or another
supported version.
In a Python worksheet, you can do the following:
Write a Python script to read data from a stage, transform it, and save it to a table, all without leaving Snowsight.
Use included packages from Anaconda or import packages from a stage to write code more easily.
Automate your Python code by deploying it as a stored procedure and scheduling it as a task.
For more information, see
Writing Snowpark Code in Python Worksheets
.
Recover worksheets for dropped users —–
General Availability
¶
With this release, we are pleased to announce the general availability of recovering Snowsight worksheets for users that have
been dropped from Snowflake. You can recover up to 500 worksheets for each dropped user.
For more details, see
Recover worksheets owned by a dropped user
