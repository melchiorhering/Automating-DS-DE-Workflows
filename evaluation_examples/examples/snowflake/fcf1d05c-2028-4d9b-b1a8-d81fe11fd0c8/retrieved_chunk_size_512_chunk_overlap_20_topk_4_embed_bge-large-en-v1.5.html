In this example, the Python code reads the contents of a compressed CSV-formatted file containing employee data,
<span>data_0_0_0.csv.gz</span>from the <span>db1.public.files</span>named stage and writes the contents to a table called <span>employees</span>.</p><div><p>Note</p><p>To run this code example, you must use a role that has:</p><ul><p>The USAGE privilege on the stage, database, and schema used in the code.</p><p>The CREATE TABLE privilege on the database schema to which you want to add the table.</p></ul></div><ol><p>Sign in to Snowsight.</p><p>Open <span>Projects</span>» <span>Worksheets</span>.</p><p>Select <span>+</span>» <span>Python Worksheet</span>.</p><p>Select a database and schema that you want to add the table to.</p><p>Select a warehouse to use to run the worksheet.

including reading data from a named stage.</p><ul><span>Example: Write a Simple Snowpark Program</span><span>Example: Transform Data in a Python Worksheet</span><span>Example: Read Files from a Stage with Python Worksheets</span></ul><p>You can review additional examples in <span>Working with DataFrames in Snowpark Python</span>.</p><section><h3>Example: Write a Simple Snowpark Program<a>¶</a></h3><p>In this example, write a Snowpark Python program that generates a small range of numbers and writes the range to a
table that your code creates, or overwrites if it already exists, in Snowflake.

Load and query sample data using Snowpark Python | Snowflake Documentation

Documentation Content:
If you’ve previously signed in to Snowsight, you might see an account name that you can select.</p><p>Sign in using your Snowflake account credentials.</p></ol></section><section><h2>Step 2. Open the Python worksheet<a>¶</a></h2><p>You can use Python worksheets to write and run Python code. Your trial account has access
to a pre-loaded Python worksheet for this tutorial. The worksheet has the Python code that
you will run to create a database, load data into it, and query the data. For more information
about Python worksheets, see <span>Writing Snowpark Code in Python Worksheets</span>.</p><p>To open the pre-loaded tutorial Python worksheet:</p><ol><p>Select <span>Projects</span>» <span>Worksheets</span>to open the list of worksheets.</p><li><p>Open <span>[Tutorial] Using Python to load and query sample data</span>.</p><p>Your worksheet looks similar to the following image.</p></li></ol><p>This pre-loaded Python worksheet automatically uses the ACCOUNTADMIN system role so that
you can view and manage objects in your account. For more information, see
<span>Using the ACCOUNTADMIN Role</span>.</p><p>The worksheet also uses the COMPUTE_WH virtual warehouse. A warehouse provides
the required resources to create and manage objects and run SQL commands. These
resources include CPU, memory, and temporary storage. For more information, see
<span>Virtual warehouses</span>.</p></section><section><h2>Step 3. Learn how to use Python worksheets<a>¶</a></h2><p>Python worksheets let you use <span>Snowpark Python</span>in Snowsight to run SQL statements. This step in this tutorial describes the code in each step
in the Python worksheet. When you use a Python worksheet, you cannot run individual blocks of
code separately. You must run the whole worksheet.
