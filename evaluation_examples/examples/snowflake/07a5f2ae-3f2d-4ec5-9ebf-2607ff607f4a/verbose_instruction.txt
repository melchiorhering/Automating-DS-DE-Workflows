Given the to-do list, we will finish all tasks following these detailed steps:
1. Click the "+ >> SQL Worksheet" button on the top right of the main page.
2. In the opened blanked page, first set the role to "accountadmin" via typing:
`USE ROLE accountadmin;`
3. Click the button with icon "â–º" in the upper-right corner of the worksheet;
4. Next, select the warehouse and run it:
`USE WAREHOUSE compute_wh;`
5. The first task is to create a Snowflake database "tasty_bytes" with schema "food", we type in:
`CREATE OR REPLACE DATABASE tasty_bytes;`
and run it to construct the database;
6. As for the schema, similarly, we write down and run the following code in the worksheet:
`CREATE OR REPLACE SCHEMA tasty_bytes.food;`
7. Then, we create the target table "menu" in schema "food" to store the source data. Copy the following codes into the opened worksheet and run it:
```
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE tasty_bytes.food.menu
(
    menu_id NUMBER,
    menu_type_id NUMBER,
    menu_type STRING,
    truck_brand_name STRING,
    menu_item_id NUMBER,
    menu_item_name STRING,
    item_category STRING,
    item_subcategory STRING,
    cost_of_goods_usd NUMBER,
    sale_price_usd NUMBER,
    menu_item_health_metrics_obj OBJECT
);
```
8. Now, we have created the database, schema and table to store the data. We are going to create a stage that holds data files from Amazon S3. Type in:
`CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE tasty_bytes.food.awsstage
url = 's3://sfquickstarts/tastybytes/raw_pos/menu/menu.csv.gz'
file_format = (type = csv);`
Remember to execute it via clicking "Run" button in the upper-right corner of this worksheet.
9. To load the data into the target table, we will use the COPY INTO command
`COPY INTO tasty_bytes.food.menu
FROM @tasty_bytes.food.awsstage;`
, then select Run.
10. After waiting for some seconds, we will see the results table with status "LOADED" and 100 rows loaded.
Till now, we have finished all jobs in the to-do list.
