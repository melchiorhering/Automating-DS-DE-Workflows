    "instruction": "Company information is stored in the snowflake database COMPANY. The employee information is stored in the table EMPLOYEES and the department information is stored in the table DEPARTMENTS. My task is to query the employees with the highest salary in each department. Please create a worksheet in the currently open snowsight interface and write the relevant code to complete the query. Finally, you need to download the result of the query and rename it to \"highest_salary.csv\". The details of the database and requirements are in the .txt on desktop.\nHere is a step-by-step tutorial from an expert instructing you how to complete it:\nThis job is to create a new worksheet on Snowflake and write sql code to complete specific query. In the opened Snowsight web page,\n1. Click \"Projects >> Worksheets\" on the left menu panel.\n2. Click \"+\" button on the right;\n3. In the drop-down menu, select \"SQL Worksheet\".\n4. In the top of the worksheet, there is a button showing \"No database selected\", click this button.\n5. In the drop-down menu, select \"COMPANY\" for the database, \"PUBLIC\" for the schema, then click anywhere to turn off the menu.\n6. Copy the code below to the worksheet:\n\nSELECT e.employee_id, e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_name, e.salary\nFROM employees e\nJOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id\nWHERE (e.department_id, e.salary) IN (\n    SELECT department_id, MAX(salary)\n    FROM employees\n    GROUP BY department_id\n);\n\n7. Click the \"Run\" button on the right-top of the worksheet.\n8. Click the \"Download Results\" button on the top-right of the result panel.\n9. In the drop-down menu, click \"Download as .csv\".\n10. In your virtual machine, navigate to the /home/user/Download directory and rename the downloaded .csv file to \"highest_salary.csv\".\nYou can exactly follow the detailed plan above or proactively tackle the task based on the real-time environment interaction by yourself.",
