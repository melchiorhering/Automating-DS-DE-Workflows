Querying data using worksheets | Snowflake Documentation

Documentation Content:
An owner or editor of a worksheet in a folder can change the worksheet to run as any role.
You can also add <span>USE ROLE</span>to a worksheet in a folder to run different statements in the worksheet as different roles.</p><p>When you create a worksheet inside a folder, the worksheet is created with the role of your current session.</p><div><p>Note</p><p>To run a worksheet in a folder that was shared with you, even if you have <span>View and Run</span>or <span>Edit</span>permissions on the folder,
you must use the same role as the worksheet. If you do not have the same role, duplicate the worksheet and run it as one of your own roles.</p></div></section></section><section><h2>Exploring the worksheet results<a>¶</a></h2><div><p>Note</p><p>Available to most accounts. Accounts in U.S. government regions, accounts using Virtual Private Snowflake (VPS), and accounts
that use Private Connectivity to access Snowflake continue to see query results limited to 10,000 rows.</p></div><p>When you run one query or all queries in a worksheet, you see the query results.</p><p>The query results display as a table. You can navigate the query results with the arrow keys on your keyboard, as you would with a
spreadsheet. You can select columns, cells, rows, or ranges in the results table. You can copy and paste any selection.</p><p>For up to 1 million rows of results, you can review generated statistics that display contextual information for any selection,
as well as overall statistics. See <span>Automatic contextual statistics</span>for more details.</p><p>If you want to view your results as a chart, select <span>Chart</span>. For more details about charts, see
