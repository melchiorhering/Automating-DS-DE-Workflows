With a worksheet, you can do any of the following:</p><ul><p>Run ad hoc queries and other DDL/DML operations.</p><p>Write Snowpark Python code in a Python worksheet.</p><p>Review the query history and results of queries that you executed.</p><p>Examine multiple worksheets, each with its own separate session.</p><p>Export the results for a selected statement, while results are still available.</p></ul><p>For more details, see:</p><ul><span>Getting started with worksheets</span><span>Managing and using worksheets in Snowsight</span><span>Querying data using worksheets</span><span>Writing Snowpark Code in Python Worksheets</span></ul></section><section><h2>Visualize query results with charts and dashboards<a>¶</a></h2><p>When you run a query in Snowsight, you can choose to view your results as a chart. You can also create a collection of charts
as a <span>Dashboard</span>, allowing you to review your data more easily. Dashboards provide flexible collections of charts arranged as tiles.
Dashboard charts start with SQL to generate results and associated charts. You can share these charts with others, modify the charts,
and display them as dashboard tiles.</p><p>To learn more about charts, see <span>Visualizing worksheet data</span>.
