Click the funnel icon under web title \"servicenow\".\n2. Click \"Add Sort\" button in the next line.\n3. Under the selection bar \"Order results by the following fields\", click and type in \"Closed by\" entry.\n4. Next, click and select the order \"z to a\" (descending) in the option box next to \"Closed by\".\n5. Then, repeat steps 2-4, to add the other two sorting methods:\n- sort field: Planned start date ; sort method: a to z ;\n- sort field: Phase state ; sort method: z to a ;\n6. After all these sorting conditions are added, we click the \"Run\" button in the top menu bar and waiting for the page refreshing.\nYou can exactly follow the detailed plan above or proactively tackle the task based on the real-time environment interaction by yourself.",
