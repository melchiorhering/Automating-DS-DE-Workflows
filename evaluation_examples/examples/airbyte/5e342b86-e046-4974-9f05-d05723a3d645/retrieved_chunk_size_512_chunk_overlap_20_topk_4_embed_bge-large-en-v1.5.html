For this tutorial I use the following default values:¬†</p><code>BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME=airbyte
BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=password
</code><p>Once Airbyte is running, in your browser type in localhost:8000, which should prompt you for a username and password as follows:</p><figcaption>Airbyte OSS¬†login prompt</figcaption><h2>Create a connection</h2><p>Create a connection that sends data from the <strong>Sample Data (Faker)</strong>source to the <strong>Local JSON</strong>(file system) output.

By default the path that you specify will be located inside <strong>/tmp/airbyte_local</strong>. In this tutorial I set the destination to <strong>/json_from_faker</strong>, which means that the data will be copied to<strong>/tmp/airbyte_local/json_from_faker</strong>on the localhost where Airbyte is running. After specifying the Destination Path, click on Set up destination.

When viewing the Airbyte UI, you'll see the main navigation bar on the left side of your screen. Click the <strong>Sources</strong>tab to bring up a list of all available sources.</p><p>You can use the provided search bar, or simply scroll down the list to find the source you want to replicate data from. Let's use a demo source, Faker, as an example. Clicking on the <strong>Sample Data (Faker)</strong>card will bring us to its setup page.</p><p>The left half of the page contains a set of fields that you will have to fill out. In the <strong>Source name</strong>field, you can enter a name of your choosing to help you identify this instance of the connector. By default, this will be set to the name of the source (ie, <code>Sample Data (Faker)</code>).</p><p>Each connector in Airbyte will have its own set of authentication methods and configurable parameters. In the case of Sample Data (Faker), you can adjust the number of records you want returned in your <code>Users</code>data, and optionally adjust additional configuration settings. You can always refer to your source's provided setup guide for specific instructions on filling out each field.</p><div><div>info</div><p>Some sources will have an <strong>Optional Fields</strong>tab. You can open this tab to view and configure any additional optional parameters that exist for the souce, but you do not have to do so to successfully set up the connector.</p></div><p>Once you've filled out all the required fields, click on the <strong>Set up source</strong>button and Airbyte will run a check to verify the connection. Happy replicating!</p><p>Can't find the connectors that you want?

After specifying the Destination Path, click on Set up destination.¬†</p><figcaption>Configure the Local JSON destination</figcaption><p>‚Äç</p><p>This will take you to a page to set up the connection. Set the replication frequency to <strong>Manual</strong>(since we will use Airflow to trigger Airbyte syncs rather than using Airbyte‚Äôs scheduler) and then click on <strong>Set up connection</strong>as highlighted in the image below.</p><figcaption>Specify connection settings</figcaption><p>‚Äç</p><p>Trigger a sync from the <strong>Sample Data (faker)</strong>source to the <strong>Local JSON</strong>output by clicking on <strong>Sync now</strong>as highlighted in the image below.</p><figcaption>Manually trigger a sync from the UI</figcaption><p>‚Äç</p><p>The sync should take a few seconds, at which point you should see that the sync has succeed as shown below.</p><figcaption>After the sync has completed</figcaption><p>‚Äç</p><p>You can now confirm if some sample data has been copied to the expected location. As previously mentioned, for this example the JSON data can be seen in <strong>/tmp/airbyte_local_json_from_faker</strong>. Because there were three streams generated, the following three JSON files should be available:¬†</p><code>_airbyte_raw_products.jsonl	
_airbyte_raw_users.jsonl
_airbyte_raw_purchases.jsonl
</code><p>You have now created a simple example connection in Airbyte which can be manually triggered. A manually triggered connection is ideal for situations where you wish to use an external orchestrator.¬†</p><p>In the next section you will see how to trigger a manual sync on this connection by hitting a REST endpoint directly. After that, you will see how Airflow can be used to hit that same endpoint to trigger synchronizations.¬†</p><h2>Test the API endpoints with cURL</h2><p>Before using the REST endpoint from within Airflow, it is useful to verify that it is working as expected.
