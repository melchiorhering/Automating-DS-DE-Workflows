In this task, we want to export the config information of the current airbyte connection into a local json file. To complete this: 
1. Switch to the browser page.
2. Click the connection row in the main panel;
3. In the Airbyte connection page, check the URL and note down the UUID string between "/connections/" and "/status/". This is the ConnectionId for that connection;
4. Switch to the terminal;
5. In the terminal, replace ${connectionId} with the ConnectionId you just noted down and execute:
```
connection_config=$(curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/connections/get -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"connectionId\": \"${connectionId}\"}")

```
6. Then, in the terminal, execute 
```
echo ${connection_config} > /home/user/Desktop/connection_config.json 
```
to save the config file.
