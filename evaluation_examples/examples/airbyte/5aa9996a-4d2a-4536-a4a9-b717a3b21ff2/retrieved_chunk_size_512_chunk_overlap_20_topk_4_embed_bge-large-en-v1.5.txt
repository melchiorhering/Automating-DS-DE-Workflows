Check the data from your first sync
​
Once the first sync has completed, you can verify the sync has completed by checking the data in your destination.
Cloud
Self Hosted
If you followed along and created your own connection using a
Google Sheets
destination, you will now see three tabs created in your Google Sheet,
products
,
users
, and
purchases
.
If you followed along and created your own connection using a
Local JSON
destination, you can use this command to check the file's contents to make sure the replication worked as intended (be sure to replace YOUR_PATH with the path you chose in your destination setup, and YOUR_STREAM_NAME with the name of an actual stream you replicated):
cat /tmp/airbyte_local/YOUR_PATH/_airbyte_raw_YOUR_STREAM_NAME.jsonl
You should see a list of JSON objects, each containing a unique
airbyte_ab_id
, an
emitted_at
timestamp, and
airbyte_data
containing the extracted record.
tip
If you are using Airbyte on Windows with WSL2 and Docker, refer to
this guide
to locate the replicated folder and file.

​
Congratulations on successfully setting up your first connection using Airbyte! We hope that this will be just the first step on your journey with us. We support a large, ever-growing
catalog of sources and destinations
, and you can even
contribute your own
.
If you have any questions at all, please reach out to us on
Slack
. If you would like to see a missing feature or connector added, please create an issue on our
Github
. Our community's participation is invaluable in helping us grow and improve every day, and we always welcome your feedback.

Now that you've learned how to set up your first
source
and
destination
, it's time to finish the setup by creating your very first connection!
On the left side of your main Airbyte dashboard, select
Connections
. You will be prompted to choose which source and destination to use for this connection. For this example, we'll use the
Google Sheets
source and the destination you previously set up, either
Local JSON
or
Google Sheets
.
Configure the connection
​
Once you've chosen your source and destination you can configure the connection. You'll first be asked a few questions about how your data should sync, these correlate to our sync modes which you can read more about on
this page
.
Most users select "Mirror Source", which will simply copy the data from the source to the destination where you'll see one row in the destination for each row in the source. If you prefer to Append Historical Changes or take a Full Snapshot with each sync, you can optionally select those options, but keep in mind those will create duplicate records in your destination. The sync mode we choose for all the enabled streams will reflect your selection here.
Next, you can toggle which streams you want to replicate.

Next, you can toggle which streams you want to replicate. Our test data consists of three streams, which we've enabled and set to
Incremental - Append + Deduped
sync mode.
Your sync mode is already determined by your selection above, but you can change the sync mode for an individual stream. You can also select a cursor or primary key to enable incremental and/or deduplication. For more information on the nature of each sync mode supported by Airbyte, see
this page
.
You can also select individual fields to sync on this page. Expand the fields available by clicking any stream. This is helpful when you have security concerns or don't want to sync all the data from the source.
Click
Next
to complete your stream setup and move to the connection configuration. This is where you'll set up how often your data will sync and where it will live in the destination. For this demo, we'll set the connection to run at 8 AM every day and sync the connection to a custom namespace with a stream prefix.
note
To ensure your data is synced to the correct place, see our examples for
Destination Namespace
Once you've set up all the connection settings, click "Set up connection". You've successfully set up your first data pipeline with Airbyte. Your first sync is about to begin!
Connection Overview
​
Once you've finished setting up the connection, you will be automatically redirected to a connection overview containing all the tools you need to keep track of your connection.
Here's a basic overview of the tabs and their use:
The
Status
tab shows you an overview of your connector's sync health.
The
Job History
tab allows you to check the logs for each sync. If you encounter any errors or unexpected behaviors during a sync, checking the logs is always a good first step to finding the cause and solution.
The
Schema
tab allows you to modify the streams you chose during the connection setup.
The
Transformation
tab allows you to set up a custom post-sync transformations using dbt.
The
Settings
tab contains the connection settings, and the option to delete the connection if you no longer wish to use it.

Using the Prefect Airbyte Task | Airbyte Documentation

2. Create a Flow in Prefect to trigger your Airbyte job
​
Create a new Prefect Project
​
prefect create project "airbyte"
Retrieving the Airbyte Connection ID
​
We'll need the Airbyte Connection ID so our Prefect Flow knows which Airbyte Connection to trigger.
This ID can be seen in the URL on the connection page in the Airbyte UI. The Airbyte UI can be accessed at
localhost:8000
.
Creating a simple Prefect DAG to run an Airbyte Sync Job
​
Create a new folder called
airbyte_prefect
and create a file
airbyte_prefect_flow.py
.
from
prefect
import
Flow
from
prefect
.
tasks
.
airbyte
.
airbyte
import
AirbyteConnectionTask
airbyte_conn
=
AirbyteConnectionTask
(
airbyte_server_host
=
"localhost"
,
airbyte_server_port
=
8000
,
airbyte_api_version
=
"v1"
,
connection_id
=
"04e128af-1092-4a83-bf33-1b8c85395d74"
)
with
Flow
(
"first-airbyte-task"
)
as
flow
:
flow
.
add_task
(
airbyte_conn
)
# Register the flow under the "airbyte" project
flow
.
register
(
project_name
=
"airbyte"
)
The Airbyte Prefect Task accepts the following parameters:
airbyte_server_host
: The host URL to your Airbyte instance.
airbyte_server_post
: The port value you have selected for your Airbyte instance.
airbyte_api_version
: default value is
v1
.
connection_id
: The ID of the Airbyte Connection to be triggered by Prefect.
After running the file,
python3 airbyte_prefect_flow.py
this will register the Flow in Prefect Server.
Access the link from the output from the previous command to see the Flow in Prefect Server, or you can navigate in Prefect UI to find the new Flow -> Access the link from the output from the previous command to see the Flow in the Prefect Server. Alternatively, you can go to the Prefect UI to find the new Flow.
