</p><p>Once you’re ready, save the changes. Then, you can run your first sync by clicking on “Sync now.” You can check your run logs to verify everything is going well. Just wait for the sync to be completed, and that’s it! You’ve synchronized two Postgres databases.</p></div><h2>Step 4: Verify that the sync worked</h2><div><p>Now, let's verify that this worked. Let's output the contents of the destination database:</p><code>docker exec airbyte-destination psql -U postgres -c "SELECT * FROM public.tutorial_users;"
</code><code>docker exec airbyte-destination psql -U postgres -c "SELECT * FROM public.tutorial_cities;"
</code><p>You should see the rows from the source database inside the destination database. Note that Airbyte added extra columns which contain metadata used to support synchronization.</p></div><h2>Wrapping up</h2><div><p>In this tutorial, you learned about PostgreSQL native replication and how to synchronize two Postgres databases with Airbyte. Apart from being straightforward, Airbyte is also highly flexible when it comes to selecting different synchronization methods for your replication.</p><p>If you enjoyed using Airbyte, you might want to check our fully managed solution: <a>Airbyte Cloud</a>.  </p><p>We also invite you to <a>‍join the conversation</a>on our community Slack Channel to share your ideas with thousands of data engineers and help make everyone’s project a success. With Airbyte, the integration possibilities are endless, and we can't wait to see what you will build.</p></div><div><h3>About the Author</h3><p>Thalia Barrera is a data engineer and technical writer at Airbyte.

</code><h3>Why and when is a primary key required</h3><p>Records that are inserted <em>or updated</em>on a source system are replicated by Airbyte to the destination during a sync operation, and initially stored in a raw data table. If a given document is updated and synchronized multiple times, the raw data table will have multiple entries for that record (as will be seen in the hands-on deep-dive later in this article). </p><p>If an Airbyte user has selected the Incremental Sync - Deduped History sync mode, then the data must be deduplicated so that a single entry in the source table only results in a single corresponding entry in the final normalized deduplicated destination table, even though multiple versions corresponding to that record may appear in the raw and historic data tables.

Wait for the sync to complete, and you should see a message like the following: </p><p>‍</p><h3>Open a Postgres terminal on the destination</h3><p>If you don’t already have a shell open to your Postgres destination, execute the following commands:</p><code>docker exec -it airbyte-destination /bin/bash
