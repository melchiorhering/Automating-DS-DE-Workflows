In the dropdown menu, change “Equal to” to “Greater than”, enter 40 in the input field, then click <strong>Add filter</strong>.</p><h2>Previewing results</h2><p>With each step, you can click on the triangle on the right to preview the results so far.</p><p>As expected, all of the subtotals are over $40 after the filter has been applied.</p><p>To close the preview, you can click on the <strong>X</strong>in the upper right of the preview.</p><h2>Summarizing data</h2><p>When we ask things like “how many,” “what’s the total,” “what’s the average,” etc., we’re talking about summarizing our data. That is, we’re talking about <a>metrics</a>. The metric in this case the number (or count) of orders after we’ve filtered for orders greater than $40. We’ll click the <strong>Pick the metric you want to see</strong>button in the <strong>Summarize</strong>step and select <strong>Count of rows</strong>.</p><p>When we click <strong>Visualize</strong>, Metabase will show us that there were 16,309 orders with a subtotal greater than $40. Said another way, there were 16,309 records in the <code>Orders</code>table that made it through our filter.</p><h2>Grouping our results</h2><p>That count is useful, but it would be even more useful if we knew <em>when</em>our customers placed these big orders—more specifically, if we knew how many greater-than-40 orders people placed each month.</p><p>We can return to the editor by hitting the back button, or by clicking on the <strong>Editor</strong>button in the upper right (the icon looks like a bulleted list). Alternatively, we can also click on the <strong>Filter</strong>and <strong>Summarize</strong>buttons to revise our question while staying on this page.</p><p>Since we want to group our results by month, we’ll click <strong>Summarize</strong>.

Questions have titles, IDs, and unique URLs you can copy and share with others.</p><p>You can play around with a question by filtering and summarizing its results, save those explorations as new questions, and add questions to dashboards. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves; for the next few examples, we’ll be using the <a>Sample Database</a>that comes with Metabase.</p><p>Click on <strong>+ New</strong>in the main nav, and select <strong>Question</strong>. You can start a new question from:</p><ul><li>A model</li><li>A raw table</li><li>A saved question</li></ul><p>For now, let’s start from <strong>Raw data</strong>&gt; <strong>Sample database</strong>&gt; <strong>Orders</strong>. Metabase will open up the query builder.</p><h2>Filtering data</h2><p>The <code>Orders</code>table has a bunch of fake data in it about product orders from a made-up company. Let’s say we want to know:</p><em>How many orders have been placed with a subtotal (before tax) greater than $40?</em><p>More precisely, this question translates to: “How many records (or rows) are in the <code>Orders</code>table that have a value greater than 40 in the <code>Subtotal</code>column?”</p><p>To find out, we want to filter the data by the field we’re interested in, which in this case is the <code>Subtotal</code>. Then we want to count the filtered rows.</p><p>In the <strong>Filter</strong>step, we’ll click the purple <strong>Add filters to narrow your answer</strong>button, and we’ll select <code>Subtotal</code>as the column to filter on.

Different charts will have different breakout options, such as <strong>Location</strong>and <strong>Time</strong>.</li><li><strong>Automatic insights</strong>: See orders for a particular category over a shorter time range.</li><li><strong>Filter by this value</strong>: update the chart based on the value you clicked: equal to, less than, greater than, or not equal to.</li></ul><p>Note that while charts created with SQL don’t currently have the drill-through menu, you can add SQL questions to a dashboard and customize their click behavior. You can send people to a <a>custom destination</a>(like another dashboard or an external URL), or have the clicked value <a>update a dashboard filter</a>.</p><p>Clicking on a table cell will often allow you to filter the results using a comparison operator, like =, &gt;, or &lt;. For example, you can click on a table cell, and select the less than operator <code>&lt;</code>to filter for values that are less than the selected value.</p><p>Lastly, clicking on the ID of an item in a table gives you the option to go to a detail view for that single record. For example, you can click on a customer’s ID to see the profile view for that customer.</p><p>When you add questions to a dashboard, you can have even more control over what happens when people click on your chart. In addition to the default drill-through menu, you can add a <a>custom destination</a>or <a>update a filter</a>. Check out <a>interactive dashboards</a>. to learn more.</p><h2>Exploring saved questions</h2><p>In Metabase parlance, every chart on a dashboard is called a “question.” Clicking on the title of a question on a dashboard will take you to a detail view of that question. You’ll also end up at this detail view if you use one of the actions mentioned above.</p><p>When you’re looking at the detail view of a question, you can use all the same actions mentioned above.

If you <em>don’t</em>provide a default, Metabase won’t execute the query until a value is supplied.</li></ul><p>In the case of <code>subtotal_var</code>, we want to:</p><ul><li>Set the <code>Variable type</code>to be <code>Number</code>(since we’re dealing with subtotals).</li><li>Change the <code>Filter widget label</code>from <code>subtotal_var</code>to <code>Subtotal</code>(just to make it easier to read).</li><li>Toggle <code>Required?</code>to be true.</li><li>Set the <code>Default filter widget value</code>to <code>0</code>. That way, when a question runs, it will return all results automatically; people can enter a higher subtotal if they wish to filter the results.</li></ul><p>Now we’re ready to plug in values into our Subtotal widget, and filter for orders with Subtotals greater than that value:</p><h3>Making a basic input variable optional</h3><p>If we want to make the filter widget optional, we can enclose the <code>WHERE</code>clause in double brackets:</p><code><span>SELECT</span><span>*</span><span>FROM</span><span>orders</span><span>[[</span><span>WHERE</span><span>subtotal</span><span>&gt;</span><span>{{</span><span>subtotal_var</span><span>}}]]</span></code><p>With the <code>WHERE</code>clause in brackets, if the viewer does not enter a subtotal, and no default is set, the query would simply return all records from the <code>Orders</code>table (i.e., Metabase would only run <code>SELECT * FROM orders</code>).</p><h3>Adding multiple filters</h3><p>We can use multiple filters as well.
