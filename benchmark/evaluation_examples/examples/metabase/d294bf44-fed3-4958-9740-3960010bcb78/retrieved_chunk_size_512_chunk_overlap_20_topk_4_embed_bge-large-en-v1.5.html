Documentation Title:
Setting up Metabase

Documentation Content:
Metabase comes with a <a>Sample Database</a>that you can play around with to get a feel for how Metabase works.</p><p>If you’re ready to connect, here’s what you’ll need:</p><ul><li>The <strong>hostname</strong>of the server where your database lives</li><li>The <strong>port</strong>the database server uses</li><li>The <strong>database name</strong></li><li>The <strong>username</strong>you use for the database</li><li>The <strong>password</strong>you use for the database</li></ul><p>If you don’t have this information handy, the person responsible for administering the database should have it.</p><h2>Connect to your database</h2><p>Now that you have your database info you can connect to your database. Sweet, sweet data at last. Just go ahead and put your info into this form and click <strong>Next</strong>.</p><p>For more on connecting to databases, see <a>Adding and managing databases</a>.</p><h2>Usage data preferences</h2><p>One last quick thing that you’ll have to decide is if it’s okay for us to collect some anonymous info about how you use the product — it helps us make Metabase better. Like the box says:</p><ul><li>Metabase never collects anything about your data or question results.</li><li>All collection is completely anonymous.</li><li>Collection can be turned off at any point in your admin settings.</li></ul><p>If you’re ready to start using Metabase, go ahead and click <strong>Next</strong>.</p><h2>Staying in touch</h2><p>At this point you are all set and ready to use Metabase. Since we like keeping in touch with our friends we made it easy to sign up for our newsletter (infrequent emails) with a single click!</p><p>Once you’re done here simply follow the link to <strong>Take me to Metabase</strong>.

</li><li>Open Metabase in an incognito browser session, or</li><li>Open Metabase in a different browser.</li></ul></li></ol><strong>Explanation</strong><p>Sometimes your browser will show an old cached list of tables.

    <code>SELECT 1

Documentation Title:
History

Documentation Content:
If you unarchive an item, but you don’t know where it’s reappeared:</p><ul><li>search for the item directly, or</li><li>check if the item’s parent collection is also in the archive.</li></ul><h3>Unarchiving multiple items</h3><p>You can unarchive multiple items at once from the same collection:</p><ol><li>Go to the collection.</li><li>Hover over the icon beside the name of the item and click the checkbox that appears.</li><li>When you’re done selecting your items, click <strong>Unarchive</strong>at the bottom of the page.</li></ol><h2>Deleting items permanently</h2><ol><li>Open the main Metabase sidebar.</li><li>Click the <code>...</code>beside the “Collections” header in the sidebar.</li><li>Click <strong>View archive</strong>.</li><li>Hover over the item and click the <strong>trash bin</strong>icon.</li></ol><p>The item will get permanently deleted from your application database.</p><p>Remember that <a>archiving</a>and deleting items can have unanticipated ripple effects on related <a>dashboards</a>, <a>subscriptions</a>, and <a>SQL questions</a>.</p><p>We recommend archiving because you can always unarchive if something breaks. If you delete an item and accidentally break something, you might have to recreate all of that work from scratch (unless you’re prepared to revert to a backup of your application database).</p><h3>Deleting multiple items permanently</h3><p>You can delete multiple items at once from the same collection:</p><ol><li>Go to the collection.</li><li>Hover over the icon beside the name of the item and click the checkbox that appears.</li><li>When you’re done selecting your items, click <strong>Delete</strong>at the bottom of the page.</li></ol></article><p>Read docs for other <a>versions of Metabase</a>.
