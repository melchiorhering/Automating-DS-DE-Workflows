Introduction to dashboards

Documentation Content:
These cards can be:</p><ul><li>Questions, such as <a>tables, charts, or maps</a></li><a>Text and header cards</a><a>Link cards</a></ul><p>You can add <a>filter widgets to dashboards</a>that filter data identically across multiple questions, and <a>customize what happens when people click on a chart or a table</a>.</p><p>You can make as many dashboards as you want. Go nuts.</p><h2>How to create a dashboard</h2><p>In the top right of the screen, click the <strong>+ New</strong>&gt; <strong>Dashboard</strong>. Give your new dashboard a name and a description, choose which <a>collections</a>the dashboard should go in, then click <strong>Create</strong>, and Metabase will take you to your shiny new dashboard.</p><h2>Adding questions to a dashboard</h2><p>There are two ways to add questions to a dashboard: from the dashboard, or from the question you want to add.</p><ul><li><strong>From a question</strong>: You can add a newly saved question to a dashboard directly from the modal that pops up after you save the question for the first time. You can also add a question to a dashboard by clicking on the ellipsis (<strong>…</strong>) at the top right of a question and selecting <strong>Add to dashboard</strong>.</li><li><strong>From a dashboard</strong>: Click on the <strong>pencil</strong>icon to <strong>edit the dashboard</strong>. Then click the <strong>+</strong>icon in the top right of the dashboard editing interface (not the <strong>+</strong>in the main navigation bar) to add any of your saved questions to the dashboard, regardless of which collection the questions are in.</li></ul><p>If your question is saved to your personal collection, you’ll only be able to add that question to dashboards in your personal collection.

To learn more, check out our <a>documentation on metadata editing</a>.</p><h2>Connecting a dashboard filter widget to a field filter variable</h2><p>So we have our SQL question with a Field Filter variable in a <code>WHERE</code>clause, and it’s time to add that question to a dashboard.</p><p>Next, we’ll need to:</p><ul><li>Create a dashboard.</li><li>Add our question to a dashboard.</li><li>Add a filter widget to that dashboard.</li><li>Connect that dashboard filter widget to the field filter variable in our SQL question.</li></ul><p>Let’s <a>create a dashboard</a>(we’ll give our dashboard the wildly unimaginative name <code>Dashboard with filter widgets</code>).</p><p>Then we’ll <a>add our SQL question to the dashboard</a>.</p><p>Next, we’re going to <a>add a filter widget to our dashboard</a>. Click on the <strong>pencil</strong>icon to enter Dashboard edit mode, then:</p><ul><li>Click on the <strong>filter icon</strong>to add a filter widget to the dashboard.</li><li>Under <code>What do we want to filter</code>, we’ll select <code>Time</code>.</li><li>For <code>What kind of filter?</code>, we’ll select <code>Date filter</code>.</li><li>Next, we’ll need to connect our widget to the Field Filter variable in our question. Click on the dropdown menu in the center of our question, and select our <code>Created At</code>Field Filter variable.</li><li>Click the <strong>Done</strong>button at the top of the screen.</li><li>Then <strong>Save</strong>the dashboard.</li></ul><p>Now we’re all wired up, and we’re ready to test out our new Date filter. This particular widget type gives us an abundance of options.

A tour of Metabase

Documentation Content:
For questions written in SQL, you can use variables in your code to create <a>SQL templates</a>, including <a>field filter</a>variables that can create smart dropdown filters.</p><p>Like query builder questions, you can use the results of models or <a>saved questions</a>as starting points for new questions, just as you would a table or view. For example, to reference question 123 like so:</p><code><span>WITH</span><span>gizmo_orders</span><span>AS</span><span>#</span><span>{</span><span>123</span><span>}</span></code><h3>Create models to use as starting data for new questions</h3><p><a>Models</a>are built with questions from either the query builder or the SQL editor. You can use them to pull together data from multiple tables, with custom, calculated columns, and column descriptions and other metadata, to create great starting data for people to ask new questions. For example, you could build a model for “Active users”, or “Priority orders”, or however you want to model your business.</p><p>If you find that you’re using the same saved question over and over as your starting data for new questions, you may want to convert that saved question to a model, which will let you add metadata like column descriptions and column types. You can also refer to models in SQL queries, just like we did above with saved questions.</p><h3>Upload spreadsheets</h3><p>You can <a>upload CSVs</a>to query and visualize in Metabase. This feature is handy for quick ad hoc analysis of spreadsheet data.</p><h3>Visualize results</h3><p>When you ask a question, Metabase will guess at the most appropriate visualization type for the results, but you can select from sixteen different visualization options.</p><p>Additionally, each visualization type has their own set of options to customize.
