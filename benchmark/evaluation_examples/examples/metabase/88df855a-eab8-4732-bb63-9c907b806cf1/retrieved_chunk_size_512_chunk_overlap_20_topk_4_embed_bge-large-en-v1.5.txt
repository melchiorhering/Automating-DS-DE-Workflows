Asking questions

Documentation Content:
Unlike other steps, the row limit step can only be added at the end of your question.
Viewing the SQL that powers your question
Under the hood, all Metabase questions are SQL (gasp!). If you’re curious to see the SQL that will get run when you ask your question, you can click the little console icon in the top-right of the notebook editor. In the modal that opens up, you’ll also be given the option to start a new query in the SQL editor using this generated SQL as a starting point (assuming you have
SQL permissions
to that database). It’s a nice little shortcut to have Metabase write some boilerplate SQL for you, but then allows you to tweak and customize the query.
Play around with saved questions
Each time you start modifying a saved question, Metabase will create a new question for you. The query builder will display the name of your starting question under
Data
.
Feel free to play around with any saved question, as you won’t have any effect on the existing question. When you hit
Save
on the question, you can choose either to save as a new question (the default), or you can overwrite the existing question you started from.
If you find yourself using the same saved question as a starting point for multiple questions, you may want to turn it into a
model
to let others know it’s a good starting place.
Question version history
For questions,
dashboards

models
, Metabase keeps a version history for the previous fifteen versions of that item.

Introduction to dashboards
What is a dashboard?
Dashboards
group a set of questions into tabs on a single page. You can think of dashboards as shareable reports that feature a set of related questions. You can set up
subscriptions to dashboards
via email or Slack to receive the exported results of the dashboard’s questions.
A dashboard comprises a set of cards arranged on a grid. These cards can be:
Questions, such as
tables, charts, or maps
Text and header cards
Link cards
You can add
filter widgets to dashboards
that filter data identically across multiple questions, and
customize what happens when people click on a chart or a table
.
You can make as many dashboards as you want. Go nuts.
How to create a dashboard
In the top right of the screen, click the
+ New
>
Dashboard
. Give your new dashboard a name and a description, choose which
collections
the dashboard should go in, then click
Create
, and Metabase will take you to your shiny new dashboard.
Adding questions to a dashboard
There are two ways to add questions to a dashboard: from the dashboard, or from the question you want to add.
From a question
: You can add a newly saved question to a dashboard directly from the modal that pops up after you save the question for the first time. You can also add a question to a dashboard by clicking on the ellipsis (
…
) at the top right of a question and selecting
Add to dashboard
.
From a dashboard
: Click on the
pencil
icon to
edit the dashboard

Questions
Asking questions
Metabase’s two core concepts are questions and their corresponding answers. To ask a question in Metabase, click the
+ New
button in the upper right of the main navigation bar, and select either:
Question
SQL query
This page covers how to ask a question using Metabase’s graphical query builder, the “Question” option.
Creating a new question with the query builder
From the
+ New
dropdown, select
Question
, then pick your starting data:
You can start a question from:
A model
. A
model
is a special kind of saved question meant to be used as a good starting point for questions. Sometimes these are called derived tables, as they usually pull together data from multiple raw tables.
Raw data
. You’ll need to specify the database and the table in that database as the starting point for your question.
A
saved question
. You can use the results of any question as the starting point for a new question.
Note that there are some kinds of saved questions that can’t be used as source data:
Druid questions
Mongo questions
Questions that use
Cumulative Sum
or
Cumulative Count
aggregations
Questions that have columns that are named the same or similar thing, like
Count
and
Count 2
The query builder
Once you select your data, Metabase will take you to the query builder. Say you selected
Raw data
>
Sample database
>
Orders
, then you’ll see something like this:
This is the query builder’s notebook editor. It has three default steps.

Documentation Title:
Sharing your work with others

Documentation Content:
To do this, click on the
Save
button in the top-right of the query builder.
Metabase will take a stab at giving your question a meaningful name, but you can (and should) use your own naming convention that’ll help you and others find your questions later on. You can also pick which
collection
to save your question in. You can think of collections like folders, to which you can add
permissions
.
Save the question you created as “Orders over $40 grouped by month”. When you save a question, Metabase asks if you want to add the question to a new or existing dashboard. Let’s say “yes” and then click on
Create new dashboard
. The dialog prompts you to create a new dashboard and give it a name and description. You can name it anything you want—we’ll call ours
My First Dashboard
.
Creating a dashboard
Dashboards are great when you have a set of answers that you want to view together. Your saved questions will be displayed as
cards
on the dashboard, which you can resize and move around.
So, after you click the button to create your dashboard, you should see your chart as a little card.
You can move and resize your chart so you can get it looking just how you want it. We’ll make ours a bit wider to let those data points breathe:
Don’t forget to click
Save
at the top to save your work when you’re done.
Sharing answers directly
Once you have asked a question or saved a dashboard, the URL in your browser will link directly to that question or dashboard. That means you can copy and paste that URL into an email or chat and let other people see what you’ve found.
This will only work if Metabase is installed on a shared server, and will require creating Metabase accounts for the people you want to share with. However, if the people you’re sharing questions with don’t have permission to the
collection
it’s stored in — or if you’ve saved it to your
Personal Collection
— they won’t be able to see what you’re sharing.
Set up an alert for your question
You can set up
alerts
on questions to have Metabase message you via email or Slack based on different criteria.
