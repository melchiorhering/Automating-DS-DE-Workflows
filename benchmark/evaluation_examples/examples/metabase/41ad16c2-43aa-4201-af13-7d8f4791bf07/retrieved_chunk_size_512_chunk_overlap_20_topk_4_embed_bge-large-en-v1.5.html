Running the Metabase JAR file

Documentation Content:
If you’re on a <a>Pro</a>or <a>Enterprise</a>plan, download the <a>JAR for the Enterprise Edition</a>.</li><li>Create a new directory and move the Metabase JAR into it.</li><li>Change into your new Metabase directory and run the JAR.</li></ol><code>java -jar metabase.jar
</code><p>Metabase will log its progress in the terminal as it starts up. Wait until you see “Metabase Initialization Complete” and visit <code>http://localhost:3000/setup</code>.</p><p>If you are using a paid version, be sure to <a>activate your license</a>.</p><h2>Local installation</h2><p>If you just want to try Metabase out, play around with Metabase, or just use Metabase on your local machine, Metabase ships with a default application database that you can use. <strong>This setup is not meant for production</strong>. If you intend to run Metabase for real at your organization, see <a>Production installation</a>.</p><p>The below instructions are the same as the quick start above, just with a little more context around each step.</p><h3>1. Install Java JRE</h3><p>You may already have Java installed. To check the version, open a terminal and run:</p><code>java -version
</code><p>If Java isn’t installed, you’ll need to install Java before you can run Metabase. We recommend version 11 of JRE from <a>Eclipse Temurin</a>with HotSpot JVM. You can run Metabase wherever Java 11 runs. The particular processor architecture shouldn’t matter (although we only test Metabase for x86 and ARM).</p><h3>2.

Documentation Title:
Running the Metabase JAR file

Documentation Content:
Download Metabase</h3><p>Download the JAR file:</p><ul><a>Metabase OSS</a><a>Metabase Enterprise/Pro edition</a></ul><p>If you want to install the <a>Pro or Enterprise editions</a>of Metabase, see <a>Activating your Metabase commercial license</a>.</p><h3>3. Create a new directory and move the Metabase JAR into it</h3><p>When you run Metabase, Metabase will create some new files, so it’s important to put the Metabase Jar file in a new directory before running it (so move it out of your downloads folder and put it a new directory).</p><p>On posix systems, the commands would look something like this:</p><p>Assuming you downloaded to <code>/Users/person/Downloads</code>:</p><code>mkdir ~/metabase
</code><p>then</p><code>mv /Users/person/Downloads/metabase.jar ~/metabase
</code><h3>4. Change into your new Metabase directory and run the jar</h3><p>Change into the directory you created in step 2:</p><code>cd ~/metabase
</code><p>Now that you have Java working you can run the JAR from a terminal with:</p><code>java -jar metabase.jar
</code><p>Metabase will start using the default settings. You should see some log entries starting to run in your terminal window showing you the application progress as it starts up.

Documentation Title:
Running Metabase on Docker

Documentation Content:
See below for instructions on <a>running Metabase in production</a>.</p><p>Assuming you have <a>Docker</a>installed and running, get the latest Docker image:</p><code>docker pull metabase/metabase:latest
</code><p>Then start the Metabase container:</p><code>docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name metabase metabase/metabase
</code><p>This will launch an Metabase server on port 3000 by default.</p><p>Optional: to view the logs as your Open Source Metabase initializes, run:</p><code>docker logs -f metabase
</code><p>Once startup completes, you can access your Open Source Metabase at <code>http://localhost:3000</code>.</p><p>To run your Open Source Metabase on a different port, say port 12345:</p><code>docker run -d -p 12345:3000 --name metabase metabase/metabase
</code><h2>Pro or Enterprise quick start</h2><p>Use this quick start if you have a <a>license token</a>for a <a>paid version</a>of Metabase, and you want to run Metabase locally.

Once Metabase is fully started you’ll see a confirmation such as:</p><code>...
06-19 10:29:34 INFO metabase.task :: Initializing task CheckForNewVersions
06-19 10:29:34 INFO metabase.task :: Initializing task SendAnonymousUsageStats
06-19 10:29:34 INFO metabase.task :: Initializing task SendAbandomentEmails

06-19 10:29:34 INFO metabase.task :: Initializing task TaskHistoryCleanup
06-19 10:29:34 INFO metabase.core :: Metabase Initialization COMPLETE
</code><p>At this point you’re ready to go! You can access your new Metabase server on port 3000, most likely at <code>http://localhost:3000</code>.</p><p>You can use another port than 3000 by setting the <code>MB_JETTY_PORT</code><a>environment variable</a>before running the jar.</p><p>If you are using a paid version of Metabase, be sure to <a>activate your license</a>.</p><h2>Production installation</h2><p>The steps are similar to those steps above with two important differences: if you want to run Metabase in production, you’ll want to:</p><ul><li>Use a <a>production application database</a>to store your Metabase application data.</li><li>Run <a>Metabase as a service</a>.</li></ul><p>If you’d prefer to use Docker, check out <a>running Metabase on Docker</a>.</p><h3>Production application database</h3><p>Here are some <a>databases we support</a>.</p><p>For example, say you want to use <a>PostgreSQL</a>.
