Databases
PostgreSQL
To add a database connection, click on the
gear
icon in the top right, and navigate to
Admin settings
>
Databases
>
Add a database
.
Fill out the fields for that database, and click
Save changes
at the bottom.
Settings
You can edit these settings at any time. Just remember to save your changes.
Display name
The display name for the database in the Metabase interface.
Host
Your database’s IP address, or its domain name (e.g., esc.mydatabase.com).
Port
The database port. E.g., 5432.
Database name
The name of the database you’re connecting to.
Username
The database username for the account that you want to use to connect to your database. You can set up multiple connections to the same database using different user accounts to connect to the same database, each with different sets of
privileges
.
Password
The password for the username that you use to connect to the database.
Schemas
You can specify which schemas you want to sync and scan. Options are:
All
Only these…
All except…
For the
Only these
and
All except
options, you can input a comma-separated list of values to tell Metabase which schemas you want to include (or exclude). For example:
foo,bar,baz
You can use the
*
wildcard to match multiple schemas.
Let’s say you have three schemas: foo, bar, and baz.
If you have
Only these…
set, and enter the string
b*
, you’ll sync with bar and baz.
If you have
All except…
set, and enter the string
b*
, you’ll just sync foo.
Note that only the
*
wildcard is supported; you can’t use other special characters or regexes.

Documentation Title:
Working with the Metabase API

Documentation Content:
Add a data source
You can add a new database using the
POST /api/database/
endpoint, and validate that database’s connection details using the
/api/setup/validate
endpoint. Once you’ve connected the database to your Metabase instance, you can rescan the database and update the schema metadata. You can even add our trusty
Sample Database
as a new database to your instance with
POST /api/database/sample_database
.
Here’s an example database creation call for a
Redshift
database.
curl
-s
-X
POST
\
-H
"Content-type: application/json"
\
-H
'x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY'
\
http://localhost:3000/api/database
\
-d
'{
        "engine": "redshift",
        "name": "Redshift",
        "details": {
            "host": "redshift.aws.com",
            "port": "5432",
            "db": "dev",
            "user": "root",
            "password": "password"
        }
    }'
Set up users, groups, and permissions
You can use the
/api/user
endpoints to create, update, and disable users, or the
/api/permissions
endpoints to set up groups or
add users to them
. Here’s an example curl command to create a user:
curl
-s
"http://localhost:3000/api/user"
\
-H
'Content-Type: application/json'
\
-H
'x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY'
\
-d
'{
    "first_name":"Basic",
    "last_name":"Person",
    "email":"basic@somewhere.com",
    "password":"Sup3rS3cure_:}"
}'
Generate reports
In Metabase, “reports” are referred to as
dashboards
. You can interact with dashboards using the
/api/dashboard
endpoint. You can
create a new dashboard
with
POST /api/dashboard/
, and
add a saved question to a dashboard
with [
POST/api/dashboard/:id/cards
].
Useful endpoints
The links in the Endpoint column below will take you to you to the first action available for that endpoint, which alphabetically is usually the DELETE action.

Documentation Title:
Setting up Metabase

Documentation Content:
We won’t be able to connect to your database without it, but you’d like to deal with all of this later, that’s okay: just click
I’ll add my data later
. Metabase comes with a
Sample Database
that you can play around with to get a feel for how Metabase works.
If you’re ready to connect, here’s what you’ll need:
The
hostname
of the server where your database lives
The
port
the database server uses
The
database name
The
username
you use for the database
The
password
you use for the database
If you don’t have this information handy, the person responsible for administering the database should have it.
Connect to your database
Now that you have your database info you can connect to your database. Sweet, sweet data at last. Just go ahead and put your info into this form and click
Next
.
For more on connecting to databases, see
Adding and managing databases
.
Usage data preferences
One last quick thing that you’ll have to decide is if it’s okay for us to collect some anonymous info about how you use the product — it helps us make Metabase better. Like the box says:
Metabase never collects anything about your data or question results.
All collection is completely anonymous.
Collection can be turned off at any point in your admin settings.
If you’re ready to start using Metabase, go ahead and click
Next
.
Staying in touch
At this point you are all set and ready to use Metabase. Since we like keeping in touch with our friends we made it easy to sign up for our newsletter (infrequent emails) with a single click!
Once you’re done here simply follow the link to
Take me to Metabase
. And if you decided to skip the newsletter sign-up, it’s cool, we still like you :)

Documentation Title:
Serialization: preloading dashboards in a new Metabase instance

Documentation Content:
Target Metabase
Setting up a target Metabase is similar. On our metanet network, we’ll set up a Postgres database to serve as our application database, then spin up another Metabase in another Docker container.
Note the changes to:
ports for both Postgres (5434) and the Metabase server (5002)
Instance names:
postgres-target
and
metabase-target
Application database:
docker run
--rm
-d
--name
postgres-target
\
-p
5434:5432
\
-e
POSTGRES_USER
=
metabase
\
-e
POSTGRES_PASSWORD
=
knockknock
\
--network
metanet postgres:12
Metabase instance:
docker run
--rm
-d
--name
metabase-target
\
-p
5002:3000
\
-e
MB_DB_TYPE
=
postgres
\
-e
MB_DB_DBNAME
=
metabase
\
-e
MB_DB_PORT
=
5432
\
-e
MB_DB_USER
=
metabase
\
-e
MB_DB_PASS
=
knockknock
\
-e
MB_DB_HOST
=
postgres-target
\
--network
metanet
\
metabase/metabase-enterprise:v1.49.11
After our Metabase instances complete their initialization (patience, this could take a minute or two), we should now have two Metabases up and running:
metabase-source at
http://localhost:5001
metabase-target at
http://localhost:5002
Add users to our source Metabase
Let’s add one Admin account, and two basic users to our metabase-source instance.
You can
add users to your Metabase manually
(i.e., in the Metabase application), but here’s a quick bash script that creates an Admin user (the initial user) and two basic users:
You’ll need to have
jq
installed to handle the JSON in this script.
