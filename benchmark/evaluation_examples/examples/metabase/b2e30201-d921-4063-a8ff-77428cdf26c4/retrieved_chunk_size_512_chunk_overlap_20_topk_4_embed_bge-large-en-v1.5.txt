Configuring Metabase
Email
Once you connect your database to Metabase, you’ll want to configure an email account to send system notifications to your organization’s users. Metabase uses email to reset passwords, onboard new users, and notify you when something happens.
To edit email settings:
Click on the
gear
icon in the upper right.
Select
Admin Settings
.
From the default
Settings
tab, click on
Email
in the left sidebar.
Metabase Cloud
Metabase Cloud manages an email server for you, so you don’t need to set up email (and you won’t see SMTP settings in your Admin console).
If you like, you can still set up:
a name for your Cloud email account (from name)
an email address to recieve email replies (reply-to address)
Configuring your email account
For Metabase to send messages to your organization’s users, you’ll need to set up an email account to send emails via
SMTP
(simple mail transfer protocol), which is an email standard that secures emails with SSL security protection.
To start, go to the Admin Panel from the dropdown menu in the top right of Metabase, then from the Settings page, click on
Email
in the left menu.
You should see this form:
Here you’ll set:
SMTP HOST
: The address of the SMTP server that handles your emails.
SMTP PORT
: The port your SMTP server uses for outgoing emails.
SMTP SECURITY
:
None
SSL
TLS
STARTTLS
SMTP Username
.
SMTP Password
.
You’ll also need to specify your:
From address
: The email address you want to use for the sender of emails.
Reply-to address
: The email address you want the replies to go to, if different from the from address.

Managing people and groups
To start managing people, click on the
gear
icon >
Admin settings
>
People
. You’ll see a list of all the people in your organization.
Creating an account
To add a new person, click
Invite someone
in the upper right corner. You’ll be prompted to enter their email, and optionally their first and last names–only the email is required.
Click
Create
to activate an account. An account becomes active once you click
Create
, even if the person never signs into the account. The account remains active until you
deactivate the account
. If you’re on a paid Metabase plan, all active accounts will count toward your user account total. If one person has more than one account, each account will count toward the total (see
how billing works
).
If you’ve already
configured Metabase to use email
, Metabase will send the person an email inviting them to log into Metabase. If you haven’t yet setup email for your Metabase, Metabase will give you a temporary password that you’ll have to manually send to the person.
Editing an account
You can edit someone’s name and email address by clicking the three dots icon and choosing
Edit user
.
Be careful: changing an account’s email address
will change the address the person will use to log in to Metabase
.
Adding a user attribute
User attributes is only available on
Pro
and
Enterprise
plans (both self-hosted and on Metabase Cloud).
To add a user attribute manually:
Go to
Admin settings
>
People
.
Find the person’s account and click the
three dot
(…) menu.
Click
Edit user
.
Click
+ Add an attribute
.

Account settings
You can view your account settings by going to the top right of the screen and clicking on the
gear
icon >
Account settings
.
Account profile
You can set your first and last names, change your email address, and set your language. See our list of
supported languages
.
Account password
You can change your password here. Note that if your Metabase uses Single Sign-On (SSO), your administrator will have disabled this password section, as your identity provider will manage logins.
If you’re having trouble logging in, see our
People can’t log into Metabase
.
Account login history
The login history lists each login, along with some location information (if available), and some client information (like Browser (Firefox/Windows)).
If you see any suspicious login attempts, change your password and notify your administrator.
A note about new login emails
Whenever you log in from a new device, Metabase will send you an email just to let you know someone (presumably you) has logged in from an unrecognized device. If you see this email, but don’t remember logging in, or don’t recognize the device, change your password and let your administrator know.
Disable animations in Metabase
This isn’t an in-Metabase setting, but just so you know: you can disable UI animations in Metabase (like sidebars sliding around, or rotating spinners) by changing the settings for your operating system so it respects the
prefers-reduced-motion
CSS media feature. This change will also affect other applications, not just Metabase. Check out the instructions for how to set the user preferences for your operating system in the
MDN Web Docs
.

Now you can go back to the Metabase Admin Panel form and enter the info there.
Approved domains for notifications
Approved domains for notifications is only available on
Pro
and
Enterprise
plans (both self-hosted and on Metabase Cloud).
Allowed email address domain(s) for new
dashboard subscriptions
and
alerts
.
Adding approved domains allows you to restrict which email addresses people can send alerts and subscriptions to. This restriction only applies to sending email to people who lack an account with that Metabase. People with accounts in a Metabase who aren’t
sandboxed
will be able to email any other person with an account in that same Metabase.
To allow all domains, leave the field empty (allowing all domains is the default).
To specify multiple domains, separate each domain with a comma, with no space in between (e.g., “domain1,domain2”).
You can also set this property using the environment variable
MB_SUBSCRIPTION_ALLOWED_DOMAINS
.
This setting doesn’t affect existing subscriptions and alerts.
Suggest recipients on dashboard subscriptions and alerts
Configuring suggested recipients is only available on
Pro
and
Enterprise
plans (both self-hosted and on Metabase Cloud).
Control which recipients people can see when they create a new
dashboard subscription
or
alert
. For example, you may want to restrict people to viewing potential recipients that belong to the same
groups
they are a member of.
Options include:
Suggest all users
Only suggest users in the same groups
Don’t show suggestions
People who are sandboxed won’t see suggestions.
