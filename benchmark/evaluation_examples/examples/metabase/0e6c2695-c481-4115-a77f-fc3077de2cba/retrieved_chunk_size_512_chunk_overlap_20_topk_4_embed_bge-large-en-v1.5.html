Guide to line charts

Documentation Content:
To create a line chart, you’ll need to pick a metric for Metabase to plot over time. For example, you could show order totals over time by setting the x axis to <code>created_at</code>and the y axis to <code>total</code>. Metabase will automatically plot the line chart:</p><p>That’s technically a line chart, but it looks more like the cardiograph of a startled hummingbird, and that’s even after Metabase has truncated the results shown. (If you hover over the gray warning triangle in the upper right, you’ll see that Metabase has only plotted 2,000 rows.)</p><p>To make the chart more legible, we can summarize the data, so each point on the line chart is an aggregate of rows—“buckets” of records. (It’s much more common to plot unaggregated rows in visualizations like <a>pin maps</a>, or a <a>scatterplot</a>, e.g., to show each product plotted by price and rating.)</p><p>As an example of an aggregated metric, let’s plot the sum of order totals for each month. Click on the green <strong>Summarize button</strong>to pull up the <strong>Summarize sidebar</strong>. Metabase defaults to counting the records, but we’re not interested in the number of orders, so we’ll click on <code>Count</code>and change it to <code>Sum of</code>and select the <code>Total</code>column from <code>Order</code>.</p><p>Next, we’ll want to group our order totals by month. In the <strong>Group by</strong>section, under <code>Order</code>, mouse over the <code>Created At</code>field click on the <code>+</code>button to add the grouping.</p><p>As soon as you add the grouping, Metabase updates the chart:</p><p>This chart is a lot easier to read.

Typically they’re used to show how many people make it through a particular sequence, such as a checkout flow on a website. The first step (or gate) would be how many people visited your site. Then how many people viewed a product page (step 2), how many added that item to their cart (step 3), and so on.</p><p>We’ll walk through how to build a funnel chart in Metabase using the Sample Database included with your installation so you can follow along. We’ll show examples both in the query builder and the sql editor:</p><ul><a>Query builder</a><a>SQl editor</a></ul><p>The Sample Database doesn’t contain events; it’s just four tables with order, product, and customer information. So we’ll have to get a little creative here to come up with examples for funnel charts.</p><h2>Funnel chart example using the query builder</h2><p>Here’s a contrived example. We’re going to pretend that the steps in our funnel are product categories (because we don’t have anything like statuses or pages or other progressions in our Sample Database). Here’s the <a>notebook view</a>of our query:</p><p>What we’ve done is joined the <code>Orders</code>and <code>Products</code>tables (see <a>Joins in Metabase</a>), summarized the count of orders, and grouped those counts by product category. Then we’ve sorted the results by count, descending. To get a funnel chart, we clicked on <strong>Visualization</strong>in the bottom left, and selected <strong>Funnel</strong>.

To change bar colors, click the color swatch and choose from the palette.</p><p>Customize your chart in the <strong>Formatting tab</strong>by adjusting numbers, separators, decimals, and scale. You can also add Prefix/Suffix as needed. In the <strong>Style tab</strong>, select colors, modify labels, choose a chart type (line, area, or bar), and position the Y-axis according to your chart preferences.</p><h2>Display settings</h2><p>In the Settings &gt; Display section, you can customize your chart in several ways:</p><h3>Add a goal line</h3><p>This specifies where you want the values to be. Metabase can <a>alert</a>you when the values exceed (or drop below) that goal. For example, you can add a goal line at 5500 and name it ‘Arbitrary Sales Goal’.</p><h3>Show values</h3><p>Toggling on ‘Show values’ places the count values above each column.</p><h3>Add a trend line</h3><p>When your data is summarized and grouped by a datetime field, you can add a trend lie. The trend line shows the general direction that your data is heading in over time. To add a trend line, simply toggle on the ‘Trend line’ option.</p><h3>Stacking options</h3><p>When creating bar or area charts with multiple series, you can choose how the series are displayed with the stacking options. You can choose not to stack the series, stack them, or stack them at 100%.
We can also set the display to a <a>stacked bar chart</a>, which we’ll get into in a bit.</p><h2>Axes</h2><p>Select <code>Axes</code>in the <strong>Settings sidebar</strong>.</p><p>Here we can specify how we want our table organized.</p><h3>Label</h3><p>Here we can hide or customize axes labels.</p><h3>Show lines and marks</h3><p>With the <strong>Show lines and marks</strong>options we can change the way the categories and quantities are represented on each axis.
