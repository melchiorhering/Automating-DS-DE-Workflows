Documentation Title:
Running the Metabase JAR file

Documentation Content:
1. Install Java JRE
You may already have Java installed. To check the version, open a terminal and run:
java -version
If Java isn’t installed, you’ll need to install Java before you can run Metabase. We recommend version 11 of JRE from
Eclipse Temurin
with HotSpot JVM. You can run Metabase wherever Java 11 runs. The particular processor architecture shouldn’t matter (although we only test Metabase for x86 and ARM).
2. Download Metabase
Download the JAR file:
Metabase OSS
Metabase Enterprise/Pro edition
If you want to install the
Pro or Enterprise editions
of Metabase, see
Activating your Metabase commercial license
.
3. Create a new directory and move the Metabase JAR into it
When you run Metabase, Metabase will create some new files, so it’s important to put the Metabase Jar file in a new directory before running it (so move it out of your downloads folder and put it a new directory).
On posix systems, the commands would look something like this:
Assuming you downloaded to
/Users/person/Downloads
:
mkdir ~/metabase
then
mv /Users/person/Downloads/metabase.jar ~/metabase
4. Change into your new Metabase directory and run the jar
Change into the directory you created in step 2:
cd ~/metabase
Now that you have Java working you can run the JAR from a terminal with:
java -jar metabase.jar
Metabase will start using the default settings. You should see some log entries starting to run in your terminal window showing you the application progress as it starts up.

Documentation Title:
Upgrading Metabase

Documentation Content:
Back up your application database
.
Download the latest version of the JAR file:
Metabase Open Source JAR
Metabase Pro or Enterprise JAR
Stop the Metabase service. Aassuming you called your service
metabase.service
), you’ll run:
sudo systemctl stop metabase.service
In your Metabase directory on your server, replace the current (older) Metabase JAR file with the newer JAR you downloaded.
Restart the service:
sudo systemctl restart metabase.service
Upgrading the Docker image
If you’re running Metabase in a Docker container:
Back up your application database
.
WARNING: If you’re not using a
production-ready database
, your application data (questions, dashboards, and so on) will have been stored in an H2 database
inside
your container. Upgrading requires swapping out your existing container for a new image with the upgraded Metabase JAR, which will wipe out your application data. We recommend switching to a production-ready database before you upgrade.
Stop the current Docker container.
Pull the latest Metabase Docker image.
Metabase Open Source:
docker pull metabase/metabase:latest
Metabase Pro or Enterprise:
docker pull metabase/metabase-enterprise:latest
Start the new Docker container. Depending on the ports and what you want to name the container, the command will look something like:
Metabase Open Source:
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -e MB_DB_CONNECTION_URI="jdbc:postgresql://<host>:5432/metabase?user=<username>&password=<password>" --name metabase metabase/metabase:latest
Metabase Pro or Enterprise:
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -e MB_DB_CONNECTION_URI="jdbc:postgresql://<host>:5432/metabase?user=<username>&password=<password>" --name metabase metabase/metabase-enterprise:latest
On startup, Metabase will perform the upgrade automatically. Once Metabase has completed the upgrade, you’ll be running the new version.

Upgrading Metabase
Instructions for upgrading to a new
Metabase release
.
Backing up your application database
The application database keeps track of all of your people, dashboards, questions, collections, permissions: all the application data in Metabase (that is, everything but the data you’ve connected to Metabase). While it’s unlikely you’ll need to roll back to your current version, a backup will do wonders for your peace of mind.
See
Backing up Metabase application data
.
Swapping in the new Metabase version
Steps differ depending on whether you’re running the JAR or a Docker image.
Upgrading a JAR running locally
If you’re running the JVM Jar file directly:
Back up your application database
.
Download the latest version of the JAR file:
Metabase Open Source JAR
Metabase Pro or Enterprise JAR
Use a terminal to access your existing Metabase process and kill it (usually CTRL-C).
Replace the existing JAR file (
metabase.jar
) in your Metabase directory with the newer version.
Restart the server:
java -jar metabase.jar
On startup, Metabase will perform any tasks it needs to complete the upgrade. Once Metabase has completed those tasks, you’ll be running the new version.
Upgrading a JAR running in production as a service
To upgrade, you’ll need to stop the service, replace the JAR with the newer version, and restart the service.
E.g., if you’re running Metabase on Debian as a service using Nginx.
Back up your application database
.

Installation and Operation
Running the Metabase OSS JAR file
To run the free, Open Source version of Metabase via a JAR file, you will need to have a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on your system.
If you have a token for the
Pro or Enterprise editions
of Metabase, see
Activating your Metabase commercial license
.
Quick start
The quick start is intended for running Metabase locally. See below for instructions on
running Metabase in production
.
If you have Java installed:
Download the JAR file for Metabase OSS
. If you’re on a
Pro
or
Enterprise
plan, download the
JAR for the Enterprise Edition
.
Create a new directory and move the Metabase JAR into it.
Change into your new Metabase directory and run the JAR.
java -jar metabase.jar
Metabase will log its progress in the terminal as it starts up. Wait until you see “Metabase Initialization Complete” and visit
http://localhost:3000/setup
.
If you are using a paid version, be sure to
activate your license
.
Local installation
If you just want to try Metabase out, play around with Metabase, or just use Metabase on your local machine, Metabase ships with a default application database that you can use.
This setup is not meant for production
. If you intend to run Metabase for real at your organization, see
Production installation
.
The below instructions are the same as the quick start above, just with a little more context around each step.
1. Install Java JRE
You may already have Java installed.
