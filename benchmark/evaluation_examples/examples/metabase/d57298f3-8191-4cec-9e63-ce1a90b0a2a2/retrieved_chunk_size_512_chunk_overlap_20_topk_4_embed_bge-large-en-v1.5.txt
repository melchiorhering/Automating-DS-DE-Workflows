Documentation Title:
Serialization: preloading dashboards in a new Metabase instance

Documentation Content:
The user ID is
admin@metabase.local
and the password is
Metapass123
.
You should see a fresh instance of Metabase.
Once you log in,
activate your license key
.
Step 3 - Create dashboards and collections in the source Metabase
We’ll need some application data to export, so let’s create some dashboards using the
Sample Database
included with Metabase. Or rather, let’s let Metabase create some dashboards for us!
In the
Try These X-Rays Based On Your Data
section, click on the card with a
yellow lightning bolt
that says something like
A look at Products
. Metabase will generate a set of questions for you that you can save as a dashboard.
Click on the
Save this
button, and Metabase will save the dashboard and its questions in a
collection
titled something like
A look at Products
.
This collection will be saved to a parent collection titled
Automatically Generated Dashboards
. You can find this collection by clicking on the Metabase logo in the upper left of the navigation bar to return to the home screen. From the home page, in the
Our Analytics
section, click on the
Automatically Generated Dashboards
section. From there you should see the collection
A look at your Products table
.
Next, create a new collection. You can call it whatever you like; we’ll use the exciting name
Default collection
, and save it to the
Our Analytics
collection.
Then we’ll move the
A look at Products
collection to our newly created
Default collection
. On the
A look at Products
collection page, click on the ellipses
…
and select
Move
.
Step 4 - Export from source Metabase
Here’s where we actually start using Metabase’s
serialization
feature.
With our
metabase-source
instance set up with some questions, now it’s time to export this data and import it into our
metabase-target
. That way we don’t have to manually recreate our Default Collection in the target Metabase.

Documentation Content:

The
Databases

Admin Panel
displays connection information about your databases:

How Metabase is connected to your Metabase instance
Sync settings
Metabase does a lightweight sync every hour to keep your in-app data current, but you can use this page to manually
sync your database
, manage sync frequency, and with some databases, determine which schemas to sync.
Editing metadata in Table Metadata
Picking clear names and adding descriptions will help people find the data they’re looking for, and provide important context for analysis. Metabase can automatically try to create human-readable names of your tables and columns for you, but if Metabase misses the mark, you can always disable the
Friendly Table and Field Names
feature.
Admins can make changes to your metadata in Metabase, by clicking on the
gear
icon in the upper right and going to
Admin settings
>
Table metadata
. The Table metadata tab displays options to
edit metadata
for the database, tables, and columns. For example, you can edit a column’s name, visibility, type, and description. You can also
remap foreign keys
to give human readable names to foreign key columns!
Some tips for making life easier for people:
When column names are confusing, you can
change their names
or
add a description
.
You can
hide
unused columns to make tables easier to digest.
You can pick your preferred
filter interface
from three options (search box, list of values, or plain input box).
Perhaps the
most important
piece of metadata you can change is the
field type
. There is a long list of
field types
to choose from. Selecting the correct type for a column can connect information across multiple tables, and give context to Metabase so it can choose visualizations appropriate for your data. For example, once you’ve accurately identified latitude and longitude columns in your table, you will be able to use
map visualizations
.
