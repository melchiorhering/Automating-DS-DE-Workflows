</code><p>If the Metabase has already been set up, then <code>first @example.com</code>will be loaded as a normal user.</p><h2>Databases</h2><p>On a new Metabase, the example below sets up an admin user account and one database connection.</p><code>version: 1
config:
  users:
    - first_name: Cam
      last_name: Era
      password: 2cans3cans4cans
      email: cam@example.com
  databases:

</code><p>To determine which keys you can specify for a database, check out the fields available in Metabase itself for the database that you want to add.</p><h2>Referring to environment variables in the <code>config.yml</code></h2><p>As shown in the Databases example above, environment variables can be specified with <code>{{ template-tags }}</code>like <code>{{ env POSTGRES_TEST_DATA_PASSWORD }}</code>or <code>[[options {{template-tags}}]]</code>.</p><p>Metabase doesn’t support recursive expansion, so if one of your environment variables references <em>another</em>environment variable, you’re going to have a bad time.</p><h2>Disable initial database sync</h2><p>When loading a data model from a serialized export, you want to disable the scheduler so that the Metabase doesn’t try to sync.

Documentation Title:
Setting up Metabase

Documentation Content:
Metabase comes with a <a>Sample Database</a>that you can play around with to get a feel for how Metabase works.</p><p>If you’re ready to connect, here’s what you’ll need:</p><ul><li>The <strong>hostname</strong>of the server where your database lives</li><li>The <strong>port</strong>the database server uses</li><li>The <strong>database name</strong></li><li>The <strong>username</strong>you use for the database</li><li>The <strong>password</strong>you use for the database</li></ul><p>If you don’t have this information handy, the person responsible for administering the database should have it.</p><h2>Connect to your database</h2><p>Now that you have your database info you can connect to your database. Sweet, sweet data at last. Just go ahead and put your info into this form and click <strong>Next</strong>.</p><p>For more on connecting to databases, see <a>Adding and managing databases</a>.</p><h2>Usage data preferences</h2><p>One last quick thing that you’ll have to decide is if it’s okay for us to collect some anonymous info about how you use the product — it helps us make Metabase better. Like the box says:</p><ul><li>Metabase never collects anything about your data or question results.</li><li>All collection is completely anonymous.</li><li>Collection can be turned off at any point in your admin settings.</li></ul><p>If you’re ready to start using Metabase, go ahead and click <strong>Next</strong>.</p><h2>Staying in touch</h2><p>At this point you are all set and ready to use Metabase. Since we like keeping in touch with our friends we made it easy to sign up for our newsletter (infrequent emails) with a single click!</p><p>Once you’re done here simply follow the link to <strong>Take me to Metabase</strong>.

Working with the Metabase API

Documentation Content:
such as adding a user or creating a dashboard. Then use the developer tools in your browser to view the request Metabase made to the server when you performed that action.</p><h2>A few things you can do with the Metabase API</h2><h3>Provision a Metabase instance</h3><p>In addition to using <a>environment variables</a>, you can use the Metabase API to setup an instance of Metabase. Once you have installed Metabase using your <a>preferred method</a>, and the Metabase server is up and running, you can create the first user (as an Admin) by posting to a special endpoint, <a>/api/setup</a>. This <code>/api/setup</code>endpoint:</p><ul><li>Creates the first user as an Admin (superuser).</li><li>Logs them in.</li><li>Returns a session ID.</li></ul><p>You can then configure settings using the <code>/api/settings</code>endpoint, set up email using the <code>/api/email</code>endpoint, and use the <code>/api/setup/admin_checklist</code>endpoint to verify your setup progress.</p><h3>Add a data source</h3><p>You can add a new database using the <code>POST /api/database/</code>endpoint, and validate that database’s connection details using the <code>/api/setup/validate</code>endpoint. Once you’ve connected the database to your Metabase instance, you can rescan the database and update the schema metadata.

Setting up Metabase

Documentation Content:
If you’ve installed Metabase on a production server, you should be really careful to remember the password for this account since it will be used to add other users, connect to databases, set up email, and more. You can also create additional admin accounts later.</p><p>For now, let’s just create an account for ourselves to explore Metabase. Type in your info, and when you’re ready to continue, click the <strong>Next</strong>button.</p><h2>What will you use Metabase for?</h2><p>Let us know your plans with Metabase so that we can best guide you.</p><ul><li>Self-service analytics for my own company</li><li>Embedding analytics into my application</li><li>A bit of both</li><li>Not sure yet</li></ul><p>Don’t worry about picking the wrong option. If you say you’re interested in embedding, Metabase will display a card with a link to the embedding settings when you (the admin) first log in to your instance. Just a little convenience thing, that’s all.</p><h2>Gathering your database info</h2><p>At this point you’ll need to gather some information about the database you want to use with Metabase. We won’t be able to connect to your database without it, but you’d like to deal with all of this later, that’s okay: just click <strong>I’ll add my data later</strong>.
