toggle, and paste the following
  schema definition into the text field:
name:string,assigned_sex_at_birth:string,count:integer
Click
Create
    table
.
Wait for BigQuery to create the table and load the data.
   When BigQuery finishes loading the data, expand the
Personal
    history
and
Project history
panel to review the job details.
Preview table data
To preview the table data, follow these steps:
In the
Explorer
panel, expand your project and
babynames
dataset, and then
    select the
names_2014
table.
In the details panel, click
Preview
. BigQuery displays the first few
    rows of the table.
The
Preview
tab is not available for all table types. For example, the
Preview
tab is not displayed for external tables or views.
Query table data
Next, query the table. The process is identical to the previous example,
except that this time, you're querying your table instead of a public table.
Click
add_box
Compose new query
. A new
Editor
tab opens.
In the
Editor
    tab
, paste the following query. This query
    retrieves the top five names for US babies that were assigned male at birth
    in 2014.

                  |- assigned_sex_at_birth: string
                  |- count: integer
Query table data
Determine the most popular girls' names in the data:
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false \
    'SELECT
      name,
      count
    FROM
      `babynames.names2010`
    WHERE
      assigned_sex_at_birth = "F"
    ORDER BY
      count DESC
    LIMIT 5;'
The output is similar to the following:
+----------+-------+
|   name   | count |
+----------+-------+
| Isabella | 22925 |
| Sophia   | 20648 |
| Emma     | 17354 |
| Olivia   | 17030 |
| Ava      | 15436 |
+----------+-------+
Determine the least popular boys' names in the data:
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false \
    'SELECT
      name,
      count
    FROM
      `babynames.names2010`
    WHERE
      assigned_sex_at_birth = "M"
    ORDER BY
      count ASC
    LIMIT 5;'
The output is similar to the following:
+----------+-------+
|   name   | count |
+----------+-------+
| Aamarion |     5 |
| Aarian   |     5 |
| Aaqib    |     5 |
| Aaidan   |     5 |
| Aadhavan |     5 |
+----------+-------+
The minimum count is 5 because the source data omits names with fewer than
5 occurrences.
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for
          the resources used on this page, delete the Google Cloud project with the
          resources.
Delete the project
If you used the
BigQuery sandbox
to query
the public dataset, then billing is not enabled for your project.
The easiest way to eliminate billing is to delete the project that you
  created for the tutorial.

Documentation Content:
Note
: If you don't plan to keep the
    resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
    selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
    delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Go to project selector
Optional: If you
    select an existing project, make sure that you
enable
      the BigQuery API
. The BigQuery API is automatically
      enabled in new projects.
Create a BigQuery dataset
Use the Google Cloud console to create a dataset that stores the data.
In the Google Cloud console, open the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
In the
Explorer
panel, click your project name.
Expand the
more_vert
View actions > Create dataset
.
On the
Create dataset
page, do the following:
For
Dataset ID
, enter
babynames
.
From the
Data location
list, choose
us (multiple regions in United States)
.
     The public datasets are stored in the
us
multi-region
location
. For simplicity,
      store your
     dataset in the same location.
Leave the remaining default settings as they are, and click
Create dataset
.
Download the source data file
The file that you're downloading contains approximately 7 MB of data about
popular baby names. It's provided by the US Social Security Administration.
For more information about the dataset, see the
Social Security Administration's dataset information page
.
Download the US Social Security Administration's dataset by opening the
following URL in a new browser tab:
https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/names.zip
Extract the file.
For more information about the dataset schema, see the zip file's
NationalReadMe.pdf
file.
To see what the data looks like, open the
yob2014.txt
file. This file
contains comma-separated values for name, assigned sex at birth, and number
of children with that name. The file has no header row.
Note the location of the
yob2014.txt
file so that you can find it later.
Load data into a table
Next, load the data into a new table.
In the
Explorer
panel, click your project name.

Simulating a Pivot Table
Use conditional statements to organize the results of a subselect query into rows and
      columns. In the example below, results from a search for most revised Wikipedia articles that
      start with the value 'Google' are organized into columns where the revision counts are
      displayed if they meet various criteria.
