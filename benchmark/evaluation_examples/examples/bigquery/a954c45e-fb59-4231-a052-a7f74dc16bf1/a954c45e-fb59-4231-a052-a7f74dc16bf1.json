Save the query results into '/home/user/Downloads/answer.csv'.\nHere is a step-by-step tutorial from an expert instructing you how to complete it:\nIn this task, we will query a public dataset `austin_bikeshare` and save the execution results into a local .csv file. Concretely,\n1. click '+' button on top of the welcome prompt \"Welcome to BigQuery Studio!\". This will open a blank query panel.\n2. write the following SQL into the blank panel \"Untitled query\":\n```\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS active_stations_count\nFROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations`\nWHERE status = 'active';\n```\n3. Click the \"> RUN\" button in the menu bar of this panel to execute this SQL;\n4. Wait for a moment. The query results will show below.\n5. Click the \"SAVE RESULTS\" button above the execution results (on the right side of the same row as panel \"Query results\");\n6. And in the drop-down menu, further click the option \"CSV (local file)\";\n7. The default download path is folder `~/Downloads`. Next, we open the terminal via clicking the terminal icon on the vertical application panel of the desktop or via pressing hot key \"Ctrl+Alt+T\";\n8. In the opened terminal, type in the command `ls ~/Downloads` to see the downloaded file name;\n9. Then, move and rename this file via typing and executing:\n`mv ~/Downloads{file_name}.csv ~/Downloads/answer.csv`\n(Remember to convert the {file_name} above to the real file name in step 8)\nYou can exactly follow the detailed plan above or proactively tackle the task based on the real-time environment interaction by yourself.",
