Documentation Title:
Create materialized views  |  BigQuery  |  Google Cloud

Documentation Content:
Add a date range filter in
the materialized view that covers expected date ranges in the query:</p><pre>CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW ...
  ...
  WHERE date &gt; '2019-01-01'
  GROUP BY date
</pre><h3>Joins</h3><p>The following recommendations apply to materialized views with JOINs.</p><h4>Put the most frequently changing table first</h4><p>Ensure that the largest or most frequently changing table is the first/leftmost
table referenced in the view query. Materialized views with joins support
incremental queries and refresh when the first or left-most table in the query
is appended, but changes to other tables fully invalidate the view cache. In
star or snowflake schemas the first or leftmost table should generally be the
fact table.</p><h4>Avoid joining on clustering keys</h4><p>Materialized views with joins work best in cases where the data is heavily
aggregated or the original join query is expensive. For selective queries,
BigQuery is often already able to perform the join efficiently
and no materialized view is needed. For example consider the following
materialized view definitions.</p><pre>CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW dataset.mv
  CLUSTER BY s_market_id
AS (
  SELECT
    s_market_id,
    s_country,
    SUM(ss_net_paid) AS sum_sales,
    COUNT(*) AS cnt_sales
  FROM dataset.store_sales
  INNER JOIN dataset.store
    ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
  GROUP BY s_market_id, s_country
);
</pre><p>Suppose <code>store_sales</code>is clustered on <code>ss_store_sk</code>and you often run queries
like the following:</p><pre>SELECT
  SUM(ss_net_paid)
FROM dataset.store_sales
INNER JOIN dataset.store
ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
WHERE s_country = 'Germany';
</pre><p>The materialized view might not be as efficient as the original query.

Analyze with data canvas  |  BigQuery  |  Google Cloud

Documentation Content:
For this example, we are going to
select the <code>bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_current</code>table.</p><p>Click <strong>Query</strong>to query the data. Enter a prompt to query the data.</p><strong>Potential result</strong><p>BigQuery data canvas generates the following query:</p><pre>SELECT
  state,
  gender,
  year,
  name,
  number
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_current`
</pre><p>BigQuery data canvas generates the results of the query. We are going to ask an
additional query to filter this data. Click <strong>Query these results</strong>.</p><strong>Prompt 2</strong><pre>Get me the top 10 most popular names in 1980</pre><strong>Potential result</strong><p>BigQuery data canvas generates the following query:</p><pre>SELECT
  name,
  SUM(number) AS total_count
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data`.usa_names.usa_1910_current
WHERE
  year = 1980
GROUP BY
  name
ORDER BY
  total_count DESC
LIMIT
  10;
</pre><p>After running the query, we get a table with the ten most common names of
children born in 1980.</p><p>For this example, we are going to visualize these results. Click <strong>Visualize</strong>.
BigQuery data canvas suggests several visualization options, including bar chart, pie
chart, line graph, and custom visualization. Click <strong>Create bar chart</strong>.</p><p>BigQuery data canvas creates a bar chart similar to the following:</p><p>Along with providing a chart, BigQuery data canvas summarizes some of the key details
of the data backing the visualization.

Documentation Title:
Window function calls  |  BigQuery  |  Google Cloud

Documentation Content:
The window frame analyzes up to three
rows at a time. Take a close look at the <code>most_popular</code>column for vegetables.
Instead of getting the most popular item in a specific category, it gets the
most popular item in a specific range in that category.</p><ul><li>fruit
<ul><li>(<mark>banana</mark>, <strong>apple</strong>) = apple is most popular</li><li>(<strong>banana</strong>, <mark>apple</mark>) = apple is most popular</li></ul></li><li>vegetable
<ul><li>(<mark>leek</mark>, <strong>cabbage</strong>, lettuce, kale) = cabbage is most popular</li><li>(<strong>leek</strong>, <mark>cabbage</mark>, <strong>lettuce</strong>, kale) = lettuce is most popular</li><li>(leek, <strong>cabbage</strong>, <mark>lettuce</mark>, <strong>kale</strong>) = kale is most popular</li><li>(leek, cabbage, <strong>lettuce</strong>, <mark>kale</mark>) = kale is most popular</li></ul></li></ul><code>SELECT item, purchases, category, LAST_VALUE(item)
  OVER (
    PARTITION BY category
    ORDER BY purchases
    ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING
  ) AS most_popular
FROM Produce

/*----------------------------------------------------*
 | item      | purchases  | category   | most_popular |

</code><p>This example returns the same results as the preceding example, but it includes
a named window called <code>item_window</code>.
