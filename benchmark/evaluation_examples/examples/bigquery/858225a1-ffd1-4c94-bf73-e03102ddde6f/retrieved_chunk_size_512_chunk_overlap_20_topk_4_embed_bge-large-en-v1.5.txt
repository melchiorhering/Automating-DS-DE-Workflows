.
Unless otherwise indicated, use the default values for all settings.
On the
Create table
page, do the following:
In the
Source
section, choose
Upload
from the
Create table
    from
list.
In the
Select file

Edit as
      text
toggle, and paste the following
  schema definition into the text field:
name:string,assigned_sex_at_birth:string,count:integer
Click
Create
    table
.
Wait for BigQuery to create the table and load the data.
   When BigQuery finishes loading the data, expand the
Personal
    history
and
Project history
panel to review the job details.
Preview table data
To preview the table data, follow these steps:
In the
Explorer
panel, expand your project and
babynames
dataset, and then
    select the
names_2014
table.
In the details panel, click
Preview
. BigQuery displays the first few
    rows of the table.
The
Preview
tab is not available for all table types. For example, the
Preview
tab is not displayed for external tables or views.
Query table data
Next, query the table. The process is identical to the previous example,
except that this time, you're querying your table instead of a public table.
Click
add_box
Compose new query
. A new
Editor
tab opens.
In the
Editor
    tab
, paste the following query. This query
    retrieves the top five names for US babies that were assigned male at birth
    in 2014.

Documentation Title:
Run a query  |  BigQuery  |  Google Cloud

Documentation Content:
In the query editor, enter a valid GoogleSQL query.
For example, query the
BigQuery public dataset
usa_names
to determine the most common names in the United States between the
years 1910 and 2013:
SELECT
  name, gender,
  SUM(number) AS total
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_2013`
GROUP BY
  name, gender
ORDER BY
  total DESC
LIMIT
  10;
Click
settings
More
, and then
click
Query settings
.
In the
Resource management
section, select
Batch
.
Optional: Specify the destination table and
location
for the query results:
In the
Destination
section, select
Set a destination table for query results
.
For
Dataset
, enter the name of an existing dataset for the
destination table—for example,
myProject.myDataset
.
For
Table Id
, enter a name for the destination table—for
example,
myTable
.
If the destination table is an existing table, then for
Destination table write preference
, select whether to append or
overwrite the table with the query results.
If the destination table is a new table, then
BigQuery creates the table when you run your query.
In the
Additional settings
section, click the
Data location
menu, and then select an option.
In this example, the
usa_names
dataset is stored in the US
multi-region location. If you specify a destination table for this
query, the dataset that contains the destination table must also be
in the US multi-region. You cannot query a dataset in one location
and write the results to a table in another location.
Click
Save
.
Click
play_circle
Run
.
If you don't specify a destination table, the query job writes the
output to a temporary (cache) table.
Optional: To sort the query results by column, click
arrow_drop_down
Open sort menu
next to the column name and select a sort order. If the estimated bytes
processed for the sort is more than zero, then the number of bytes is
displayed at the top of the menu.
Optional: To see visualization of your query results, go to the
Chart
tab.

Query table data
Determine the most popular girls' names in the data:
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false \
    'SELECT
      name,
      count
    FROM
      `babynames.names2010`
    WHERE
      assigned_sex_at_birth = "F"
    ORDER BY
      count DESC
    LIMIT 5;'
The output is similar to the following:
+----------+-------+
|   name   | count |
+----------+-------+
| Isabella | 22925 |
| Sophia   | 20648 |
| Emma     | 17354 |
| Olivia   | 17030 |
| Ava      | 15436 |
+----------+-------+
Determine the least popular boys' names in the data:
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false \
    'SELECT
      name,
      count
    FROM
      `babynames.names2010`
    WHERE
      assigned_sex_at_birth = "M"
    ORDER BY
      count ASC
    LIMIT 5;'
The output is similar to the following:
+----------+-------+
|   name   | count |
+----------+-------+
| Aamarion |     5 |
| Aarian   |     5 |
| Aaqib    |     5 |
| Aaidan   |     5 |
| Aadhavan |     5 |
+----------+-------+
The minimum count is 5 because the source data omits names with fewer than
5 occurrences.
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for
          the resources used on this page, delete the Google Cloud project with the
          resources.
Delete the project
If you used the
BigQuery sandbox
to query
the public dataset, then billing is not enabled for your project.
The easiest way to eliminate billing is to delete the project that you
  created for the tutorial.
