1. We can find one connection from File to Snowflake in the main panel. Click this row;
2. In the new window, choose the "Settings" button in the menu bar;
3. Then, click the button "Delete this connection";
4. A dialogue window will pop up. In the input box, type in the name of this connection "File (CSV, JSON, Excel, Feather, Parquet) â†’ Snowflake";

7. Choose the configured data source "File";
8. Scroll down to the bottom of the settings window;
9. Click the button "Delete this source" at the bottom left;
10. Similarly, we need to type in the correct source name in the pop-up window, that is "File (CSV, JSON, Excel, Feather, Parquet)";
