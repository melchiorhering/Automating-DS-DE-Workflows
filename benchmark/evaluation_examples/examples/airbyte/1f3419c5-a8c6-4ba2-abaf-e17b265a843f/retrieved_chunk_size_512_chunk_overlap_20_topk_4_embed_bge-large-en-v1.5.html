</blockquote><p>‍</p><h3>Update: Modify a record in the source</h3><p>Go back to the Postgres shell in the<em>airbyte-source </em>container that you opened earlier in this tutorial, and update a record in <em>table_one</em>and view the table as follows:</p><code>UPDATE table_one SET name='Eg2b IncAp' WHERE id=2;
SELECT * FROM table_one;
</code><p>‍</p><p>And the source <em>table_one</em>table should now look as follows:</p><code>id |    name    |         updated_at

  2 | Eg2b IncAp | 2022-09-01 11:16:38.093877
(2 rows)
</code><p>‍</p><p>The <em>name</em>and the <em>updated_at</em>values have been updated as expected. Execute a new sync by clicking on<em>Sync Now</em>in the connections UI and wait for the sync to complete. You should see a response indicating that one record has been emitted, as follows: </p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><blockquote>ℹ️  Note that opposed to the full sync modes discussed in the <a>previous tutorial</a>which would emit all of the records in the source on each sync, in the incremental sync modes only new or modified records are emitted – this is handled in the source connector logic, which only selects new documents in the source for replication to the destination.</blockquote><p>A single record has been emitted, which corresponds to the record that was just updated. Additionally, make a note of the<em>job ID </em>and the <em>attempt ID </em>which in this case are 150 and 0. You will use these values later to view the SQL that has been used for normalization.

This is easiest to see for yourself via a hands-on example, as presented below.</p><h3>Create a full refresh append connection</h3><p>Set up a new connection that will demonstrate <strong>full refresh | append</strong>functionality, using the connectors that you created earlier in this tutorial.</p><p>First, select <strong>Postgres-source</strong>as the source for this connection.</p><p>‍</p><p>Then select <strong>Postgres-destination </strong>as the destination for this connection.</p><p>‍</p><p>Then create a new connection and name it <strong>full-refresh-append</strong>, set the prefix to <strong>append</strong>_ ,and select <strong>full refresh | append</strong>as the sync mode, as shown below.</p><p>A sync should automatically start after you create the connection. Wait for the sync to complete, and you should see a message like the following: </p><p>‍</p><h3>Open a Postgres terminal on the destination</h3><p>If you don’t already have a shell open to your Postgres destination, execute the following commands:</p><code>docker exec -it airbyte-destination /bin/bash
psql --username=postgres
</code><p>‍</p><p>You can view the tables in the destination Postgres database by executing the following command from the Postgres shell that you have just opened . </p><code>\dt;
</code><p>‍</p><p>Which should respond with the following: </p><code>List of relations
 Schema |                   Name                   | Type  |  Owner

Once it completes you should see the following status in the <em>Sync History</em>:</p><p>‍</p><p>Make a note of the<em>job ID </em>and the<em>attempt ID </em>which in this case are 149 and 0 respectively, as can be seen in the path to the<em>logs.log </em>(/tmp/workspace/149/0/logs.log) in the screenshot above. You will need these values to find the SQL code used for the first<em>incremental append </em>sync.</p><h3>Initial creation: Overview</h3><p>In the first synchronization, Airbyte replicates all of the records from the source table into a raw table in the destination database. Then, dbt-generated SQL commands are executed to normalize the raw data into the final destination table as shown below:</p><p>‍</p><h3>Initial creation: Look at the Postgres destination</h3><p>After the first sync has completed you can take a look at the Postgres destination to see how the replicated data looks. Execute the following command to open a shell to the destination Postgres database:</p><code>docker exec -it airbyte-destination psql --username=postgres
</code><p>‍</p><p>You can then view the names of the tables in the destination with the following command:</p><code>\dt;
</code><p>‍</p><p>Which should respond with the following. </p><code>List of relations
 Schema |          Name          | Type  |  Owner   
--------+------------------------+-------+----------
 public | _airbyte_raw_table_one | table | postgres
 public | table_one              | table | postgres
(2 rows)
</code><h3>Initial creation: View the raw table in the destination</h3><p>As a first step in each sync operation, Airbyte copies the records from <em>table_one</em>in the source database into a raw table in  the destination database called <em>_airbyte_raw_table_one</em>.
