Set up your Postgres source

On Airbyte Cloudor Airbyte Open Source, click “new connection”. This will bring you to a screen where you can select your data source. Choose “Postgres” as your source type.

!Now you will be brought to a screen where you need to enter some specific information about your Postgres database. This includes host, port, database name, and a list of the schemas you wish to sync. 

I kept the default port and added my database named `development`, `customers` schema, and the login information for my Airbyte user. It is best practice to create users specific to the toolsyou are connecting to your database.

!### Set up your Snowflake destination

Now let’s set up our Snowflake destinationwhere we will be replicating our Postgres data to. Start by clicking on “new destination” in the top right corner. Then select “Snowflake” as your destination type.

‍

!This is where you will input the information for the Snowflake database that you are copying your Postgres data. Make sure you enter the right location information! 

I also recommend setting up a role that is specific for loading data in your destination as well. This will help keep your environment secure and all you to closely monitor different metrics on the replication process.

Once Terraform completes its tasks, navigate to the Airbyte UI. Here, you should see your source and destination connectors, as well as the connection between them, set up and ready to go.

Next Steps
----------

Once you've set up and launched this initial integration, the real power lies in its adaptability and extensibility. Here’s a roadmap to help you customize and harness this project tailored to your specific data needs:

**Extend the Project**:

The real beauty of this integration is its extensibility. Whether you want to add more data sources, integrate additional tools, or add some transformation logic – the floor is yours. With the foundation set, sky's the limit for how you want to extend and refine your data processes.

--------------------------------

Try Airbyte freeWelcome to the "Postgres Snowflake Data Integration Stack" repository! This repo provides a quickstart template for integrating postgres data to snowflake warehouses using Airbyte powering terraform. We will easily integrate data from Postgres databases with Airbyte using terraform airbyte provider. This template could be act as a starter for integrating and also adding new sources, etc... the limits are endless.

This quickstart is designed to minimize setup hassles and propel you forward.

Infrastructure Layout
---------------------

!Prerequisites
-------------

Before you embark on this integration, ensure you have the following set up and ready:

1. **Python 3.10 or later**: If not installed, download and install it from Python's official website.
2. **Docker and Docker Compose (Docker Desktop)**: Install Dockerfollowing the official documentation for your specific OS.
3. **Airbyte OSS version**: Deploy the open-source version of Airbyte. Follow the installation instructions from the Airbyte Documentation.
4. **Terraform**: Terraform will help you provision and manage the Airbyte resources. If you haven't installed it, follow the official Terraform installation guide.

1. Setting an environment for your project
------------------------------------------

Get the project up and running on your local machine by following these steps:

**1.

Documentation Content:
Clone the repository (Clone only this quickstart)**:

`git clone --filter=blob:none --sparse  https://github.com/airbytehq/quickstarts.git``cd quickstarts``git sparse-checkout add postgres_snowflake_integration`**2. Navigate to the directory**:

`cd postgres_snowflake_integration`**3. Set Up a Virtual Environment (You may skip this and the following step if you don't want to develop or contribute)**:

For Linux and Mac:

`python3 -m venv venv``source venv/bin/activate`For Windows:

`python -m venv venv``.\venv\Scripts\activate`**4. Install Dependencies**:

`pip install -e ".[dev]"`2. Setting Up Airbyte Connectors with Terraform
-----------------------------------------------

Airbyte allows you to create connectors for sources and destinations, facilitating data synchronization between various platforms. In this project, we're harnessing the power of Terraform to automate the creation of these connectors and the connections between them. Here's how you can set this up:

**1. Navigate to the Airbyte Configuration Directory**:

Change to the relevant directory containing the Terraform configuration for Airbyte:

`cd infra/airbyte`**2. Modify Configuration Files**:

Within the infra/airbyte directory, you'll find three crucial Terraform files:

* **provider.tf:**Defines the Airbyte provider.
* **main.tf:**Contains the main configuration for creating Airbyte resources.
* **variables.tf:**Holds various variables, including credentials.

Adjust the configurations in these files to suit your project's needs. Specifically, provide credentials for your Postgres connections. You can utilize the variables.tf file to manage these credentials.

**3. Initialize Terraform**:

This step prepares Terraform to create the resources defined in your configuration files.

`terraform init`**4. Review the Plan**:

Before applying any changes, review the plan to understand what Terraform will do.

`terraform plan`**5. Apply Configuration**:

After reviewing and confirming the plan, apply the Terraform configurations to create the necessary Airbyte resources.

`terraform apply`**6.
