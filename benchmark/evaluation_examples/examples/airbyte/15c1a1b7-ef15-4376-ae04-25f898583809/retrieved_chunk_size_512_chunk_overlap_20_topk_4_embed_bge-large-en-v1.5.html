How to Connect & Load Data from Postgres to BigQuery?

Documentation Content:
Obtain the name of the database you just created. </p><p>5. In Airbyte, navigate to the PostgreSQL source connector and click on "Create Connection". </p><p>6. Enter a name for your connection and fill in the required fields, including the hostname or IP address, port number, database name, username, and password. </p><p>7. Test the connection to ensure that Airbyte can successfully connect to your PostgreSQL database. </p><p>8. Select the tables or views you want to replicate and configure any necessary settings, such as the replication frequency and the replication method. </p><p>9. Save your configuration and start the replication process. </p><p>10. Monitor the replication process to ensure that it is running smoothly and troubleshoot any issues that arise.</p></div></div><div><h2>Step 2: Set up BigQuery as a destination connector</h2><div><p>1. First, navigate to the Airbyte dashboard and select the "Destinations" tab on the left-hand side of the screen. </p><p>2. Scroll down until you find the "BigQuery" destination connector and click on it. </p><p>3. Click the "Create Destination" button to begin setting up your BigQuery destination. </p><p>4. Enter your Google Cloud Platform project ID and service account credentials in the appropriate fields. </p><p>5. Next, select the dataset you want to use for your destination and enter the table prefix you want to use. </p><p>6. Choose the schema mapping for your data, which will determine how your data is organized in BigQuery. </p><p>7. Finally, review your settings and click the "Create Destination" button to complete the setup process. </p><p>8. Once your destination is created, you can begin configuring your source connectors to start syncing data to BigQuery. </p><p>9. To do this, navigate to the "Sources" tab on the left-hand side of the screen and select the source connector you want to use. </p><p>10.

How to Build a Slack Activity Dashboard with Apache Superset | Airbyte | Airbyte

Documentation Content:
You’ve got Superset set up. Now let’s tell Superset about our Postgres Database holding the Slack data from Airbyte.</p><h3>Setting Up a Postgres Database in Superset</h3><p>To do this, on the top menu in your Superset dashboard, hover on the Data dropdown and click on <strong>Databases.</strong></p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>In the page that opens up, click on the <strong>+ Database </strong>button in the top right corner.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>Then, you will be presented with a modal to add your Database Name and the connection URI.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>Let’s call our Database <strong>slack_db,</strong>and then add the following URI as the connection URI:</p><code>postgresql://postgres:password@docker.for.mac.localhost:2000/postgres
</code><p>‍</p><strong>If you are on a Windows Machine, yours will be:</strong><code>postgresql://postgres:password@docker.for.win.localhost:2000/postgres
</code><p>‍</p><p>Note: We are using <strong>docker.for.[mac|win].localhost</strong>in order to access the localhost of your machine, because using just <em>localhost</em>will point to the Docker container network and not your machine’s network.</p><p>Your Superset UI should look like this:</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>We will need to enable some settings on this connection.

Enter the values for the Postgres container we created earlier:</p><ul><li>host - localhost</li><li>post - 3003</li><li>schema - public (leave default)</li><li>database - postgres</li><li>Password - password</li><li>username - postgres</li></ul><p>Then click on the basic normalization toggle button to check it on as we want Airbyte to normalize the data coming in from GitHub. Overall the UI should look like this:</p><p>Then click on the Set up destination button. If your credentials are all good for the database, the postgres destination would have been set, and now you will need to make the connection from the source (GitHub) to the destination (Postgres).</p><p>You should check the boxes that are checked in the screenshot below, and then choose how often Airbyte will attempt to replicate data to be every hour in the Sync frequency drop down. Then, click on the <em>Set up connection</em>button.</p><p>You will be taken to the source page, click on the source and you will see the status of your sync. The sync should take a while to complete.</p><p>When done, you will see the status change from running to Succeeded. Also, the byte count will be referring to the byte of data Airbyte has pulled from GitHub into your Postgres database.</p><p>‍</p><p>That wasn’t a lot of work, was it? You can pat yourself in the back as you just synced data from GitHub to a Postgres database.</p><p>Let's move on to connecting that database to Metabase, so we can start creating our dashboard.</p></div><h2>Step 2: Connecting the PostgreSQL database to Metabase</h2><div><h3>Installing Metabase</h3><p>‍Metabase is an open source analytic tool that you can get started working with in a couple of ways; using the .jar file, installing it as a Mac app or using a Docker container.For this tutorial we will be using the Mac app(you can alternatively look up the installation that suits you <a>here</a>).

Postgres | Airbyte Documentation

Documentation Content:
If your database is within a VPC, you
may need to allow access from the IP you're using to expose Airbyte.</p><h2>Step 1: Set up Postgres<a>​</a></h2><h4><strong>Permissions</strong><a>​</a></h4><p>You need a Postgres user with the following permissions:</p><ul><li>can create tables and write rows.</li><li>can create schemas e.g:</li></ul><p>You can create such a user by running:</p><code><span>CREATE USER airbyte_user WITH PASSWORD '&lt;password&gt;';</span><span>GRANT CREATE, TEMPORARY ON DATABASE &lt;database&gt; TO airbyte_user;</span></code><p>You can also use a pre-existing user but we highly recommend creating a dedicated user for Airbyte.</p><h2>Step 2: Set up the Postgres connector in Airbyte<a>​</a></h2><h4>Target Database<a>​</a></h4><p>You will need to choose an existing database or create a new database that will be used to store
synced data from Airbyte.</p><h2>Naming Conventions<a>​</a></h2><p>From
<a>Postgres SQL Identifiers syntax</a>:</p><ul><p>SQL identifiers and key words must begin with a letter (a-z, but also letters with diacritical
marks and non-Latin letters) or an underscore (_).</p><li><p>Subsequent characters in an identifier or key word can be letters, underscores, digits (0-9), or
dollar signs ($).</p><p>Note that dollar signs are not allowed in identifiers according to the SQL standard, so their use
might render applications less portable. The SQL standard will not define a key word that contains
digits or starts or ends with an underscore, so identifiers of this form are safe against possible
conflict with future extensions of the standard.</p></li><p>The system uses no more than NAMEDATALEN-1 bytes of an identifier; longer names can be written in
commands, but they will be truncated.
