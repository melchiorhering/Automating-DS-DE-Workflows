Orchestrate ELT pipelines with Prefect, Airbyte and dbt | Airbyte

Documentation Content:
In this recipe we’ll create a Prefect flow to orchestrate Airbyte and dbt.

**Airbyte**is a data integration tool that allows you to extract data from APIs and databases and load it to data warehouses, data lakes, and databases. In this recipe, we’ll use Airbyte to replicate data from the GitHub API into a Snowflake warehouse.

**dbt**is a data transformation tool that allows you to transform data within a data warehouse more effectively. We’ll use dbt in this recipe to transform data from multiple sources into one table to find common contributors between our three repositories.

Prerequisites
-------------

In order to follow the steps in this recipe you’ll need to make sure that you have the following installed on your local machine:

* Docker and Docker Compose
* Python 3.8+
Set up Snowflake
----------------

For this tutorial, you can set up a Snowflake account if you don’t already have one. Snowflake has a generous free tier, so no cost will be incurred while going through this recipe. Airbyte requires some resources to be created in Snowflake to enable data replication from GitHub. You can refer to the Airbyte Snowflake destination documentationfor the steps necessary to configure Snowflake to allow Airbyte to load data in.

Airbyte, dbt and Airflow (ADA) Stack with Snowflake | Airbyte

Documentation Content:
Execute the Pipeline in Airflow**:

Navigate to the Airflow UI and Trigger the DAG. This triggers the entire pipeline, encompassing the extraction via Airbyte, transformations via dbt, and any other subsequent steps. Modify the schedule as well to suit your use case.

**4. Extend the Project**:

The real beauty of this integration is its extensibility. Whether you want to add more data sources, integrate additional tools, or enhance your transformation logic – the floor is yours. With the foundation set, sky's the limit for how you want to extend and refine your data processes.

Here are some ideas to continue your project:

**Expand your data sources**This quickstart uses a very simple data source. Airbyte provides hundreds of sources that might be integrated into your pipeline. And besides configuring and orchestrating them, don't forget to add them as sources in your dbt project. This will make sure you have a lineage graph like the one we showed in the beginning of this document.

**Dive into dbt and improve your transformations**dbt is a very powerful tool, and it has lots of features that can help you improve your transformations. You can find more details in the dbt Documentation. It's very important that you understand the types of materializations and incremental models, as well as understanding the models, sources, metrics and everything else that dbt provides.

**Apply Data Quality into your pipeline**dbt provides a simple test framework that is a good starting point, but there is a lot more you can do to ensure your data is correct. You can use Airflow to run manual data quality checks, by using Sensorsor operators that run custom queries. You can also use specialized tools such as Great Expectationsto create more complex data quality checks.

**Monitoring and alerts**Airflow's UI is a good start for simple monitoring, but as your pipelines scale it might be useful to have a more robust monitoring solution. You can use tools such as Prometheusand Grafanato create dashboards and alerts for your pipelines, but you can create notifications using Airflowor other tools such as re\_data.

**Contribute with the community**All tools mentioned here are open-source and have very active communities. You can contribute with them by creating issues, suggesting features, or even creating pull requests. You can also contribute with the Airbyte community by creating connectorsfor new sources and destinations.

Next Steps
----------

Congratulations on successfully deploying and running the E-commerce Analytics Quickstart! You've taken a significant step in harnessing the power of Airbyte, dbt, Dagster, and BigQuery for data analytics. 

Here's what you can do next to deepen your understanding and maximize the value of your project:

**Explore the data and insights:**- Now that you have your data pipeline set up, it's time to explore the datasets in BigQuery. Run some queries, visualize the data, and start uncovering insights. Look for trends, patterns, or anomalies that could help in making informed business decisions. This exploration is vital to understand your data's story and its implications.
**Optimize the dbt models:*** Reflect on the transformations you've implemented using dbt. Is there room for efficiency improvements? Consider optimizing your existing models for performance or scalability.
* Additionally, think about new models you could create. As your business needs evolve, so too should your data models. Tailor them to extract deeper or more specific insights that can drive strategic initiatives.

**Expand the data sources:*** Your data ecosystem is not limited to what you've set up so far. With Airbyte's vast array of connectors, explore adding more data sources. Integrating different types of data can enrich your datasets, offering a more comprehensive view of your business landscape.
* Think about social media data, web traffic analytics, customer feedback, and other data sources that could provide a fuller picture of your e-commerce business.

**Contribute to the community:*** As you learn and improve your setup, consider sharing your experiences with the community. Write blog posts, create tutorials, or contribute to forums.
* If you've developed enhancements or new ideas for the Quickstarts repository, consider contributing them back to the quickstarts GitHub repository. This not only helps others who are following the same path but also enriches the repository with diverse perspectives and ideas.
