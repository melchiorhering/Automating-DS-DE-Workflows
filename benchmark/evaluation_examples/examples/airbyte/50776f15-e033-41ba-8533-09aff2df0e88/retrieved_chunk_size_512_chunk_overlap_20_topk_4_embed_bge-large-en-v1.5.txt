Create a Faker source
2. Create a destination:
Go to the Destinations tab and click on "+ New destination".
Search for ‚Äúbigquery‚Äù using the search bar and select "BigQuery".

3. Create a connection:
Go to the Connections tab and click on "+ New connection".
Select the source and destination you just created.
Enter the connection details as needed.
For this project, leave the ‚Äúreplication frequency‚Äù as ‚ÄúManual‚Äù, since we will orchestrate the syncs with Dagster.

4. Setting Up the dbt Project
dbt (data build tool)
allows you to transform your data by writing, documenting, and executing SQL workflows. Setting up the dbt project requires specifying connection details for your data platform, in this case, BigQuery.
1. Navigate to the dbt Project Directory:
Move to the dbt project directory in your project's file structure.
cd ../../dbt_project
This directory contains all the dbt-related configurations and SQL models.
2. Update Connection Details:
Within this directory, you'll find a <span class="text-style-code">profiles.yml file</span>. This file holds the configuration for dbt to connect to BigQuery.

Setting Up the dbt Project
dbt (data build tool)
allows you to transform your data by writing, documenting, and executing SQL workflows. Setting up the dbt project requires specifying connection details for your data platform, in this case, BigQuery. Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide to help you set this up:
1. Navigate to the dbt Project Directory
:
Move to the directory containing the dbt configuration:
cd ../../dbt_project
2. Update Connection Details
:
You'll find a <span class="text-style-code">profiles.yml</span> file within the directory. This file contains configurations for dbt to connect with your data platform. Update this file with your BigQuery connection details. Specifically, you need to update the Service Account JSON file path and your BigQuery project ID.
Provide your BigQuery project ID in the database field of the <span class="text-style-code">dbt_project/models/sources/faker_sources.yml</span> file.

7. Test the connection to ensure that Airbyte can successfully connect to your PostgreSQL database.
8. Select the tables or views you want to replicate and configure any necessary settings, such as the replication frequency and the replication method.
9. Save your configuration and start the replication process.
10. Monitor the replication process to ensure that it is running smoothly and troubleshoot any issues that arise.
Step 2: Set up BigQuery as a destination connector
1. First, navigate to the Airbyte dashboard and select the "Destinations" tab on the left-hand side of the screen.
2. Scroll down until you find the "BigQuery" destination connector and click on it.
3. Click the "Create Destination" button to begin setting up your BigQuery destination.
4. Enter your Google Cloud Platform project ID and service account credentials in the appropriate fields.
5. Next, select the dataset you want to use for your destination and enter the table prefix you want to use.
6. Choose the schema mapping for your data, which will determine how your data is organized in BigQuery.
7. Finally, review your settings and click the "Create Destination" button to complete the setup process.
8. Once your destination is created, you can begin configuring your source connectors to start syncing data to BigQuery.
9. To do this, navigate to the "Sources" tab on the left-hand side of the screen and select the source connector you want to use.
10. Follow the prompts to enter your source credentials and configure your sync settings.
11. When you reach the "Destination" step, select your BigQuery destination from the dropdown menu and choose the dataset and table prefix you want to use.
12. Review your settings and click the "Create Connection" button to start syncing data from your source to your BigQuery destination.
Step 3: Set up a connection to sync your Postgres data to BigQuery
Once you've successfully connected Postgres as a data source and BigQuery as a destination in Airbyte, you can set up a data pipeline between them with the following steps:
Create a new connection:
On the Airbyte dashboard, navigate to the 'Connections' tab and click the '+ New Connection' button.
Choose your source:
Select Postgres from the dropdown list of your configured sources.
