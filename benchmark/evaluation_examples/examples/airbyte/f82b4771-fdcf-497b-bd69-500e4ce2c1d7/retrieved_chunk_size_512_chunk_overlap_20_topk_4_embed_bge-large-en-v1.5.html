This is easiest to see for yourself via a hands-on example, as presented below.</p><h3>Create a full refresh append connection</h3><p>Set up a new connection that will demonstrate <strong>full refresh | append</strong>functionality, using the connectors that you created earlier in this tutorial.</p><p>First, select <strong>Postgres-source</strong>as the source for this connection.</p><p>‍</p><p>Then select <strong>Postgres-destination </strong>as the destination for this connection.</p><p>‍</p><p>Then create a new connection and name it <strong>full-refresh-append</strong>, set the prefix to <strong>append</strong>_ ,and select <strong>full refresh | append</strong>as the sync mode, as shown below.</p><p>A sync should automatically start after you create the connection. Wait for the sync to complete, and you should see a message like the following: </p><p>‍</p><h3>Open a Postgres terminal on the destination</h3><p>If you don’t already have a shell open to your Postgres destination, execute the following commands:</p><code>docker exec -it airbyte-destination /bin/bash
psql --username=postgres
</code><p>‍</p><p>You can view the tables in the destination Postgres database by executing the following command from the Postgres shell that you have just opened . </p><code>\dt;
</code><p>‍</p><p>Which should respond with the following: </p><code>List of relations
 Schema |                   Name                   | Type  |  Owner   
--------+------------------------------------------+-------+----------

 public | append_full_refresh_demo                 | table | postgres
 public | overwrite_full_refresh_demo              | table | postgres
(4 rows)
</code><p>‍</p><p>Two new tables have been created, <strong>_airbyte_raw_append_full_refresh_demo</strong>and <strong>append_full_refresh_demo</strong>.

Configure an Airbyte destination destination called <strong>Postgres-destination</strong>as follows:</p><h2>Database synchronization with full refresh overwrite</h2><div><p>In this section you will create an <a>Airbyte connection</a>that reads data from the Postgres source and drives it into the Postgres destination using the <strong>full refresh | overwrite</strong>replication mode. In this mode, all data in the source database is sent to the destination database, regardless of whether it has been synced before or not. You can see this for yourself by following along the steps presented below.</p><h3>Create a full refresh overwrite connection</h3><p>Create a new connection that will be used for verifying the functionality of <strong>full refresh | overwrite</strong>synchronization. Select the <strong>Postgres-source</strong>source, which you previously defined, as the source for this connection.</p><p>‍</p><p>And select <strong>Postgres-destination,</strong>which you previously defined, as the destination for this connection.</p><p>‍</p><p>You will see a set up page as shown below. Set the name of the connection to <strong>full-refresh-overwrite</strong>, and the destination stream prefix as <strong>overwrite_</strong>as shown below.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>After you set up the connection, you should see that a first sync has automatically started.  Once it completes, you should see a message indicating that two records have been emitted as follows:</p><p>.</p><h3>Open a Postgres terminal in the destination container</h3><p>‍</p><p>Now that the first sync has completed you can take a look at the Postgres destination to see how the replicated data looks.

</code><p>‍</p><p>Looking at the <strong>_airbyte_emitted_at</strong>timestamp and the <strong>_airbyte_normalized_at</strong>timestamp confirms that every record has been overwritten and re-normalized. In other words, even if no data was modified in the Postgres source, the entire table is copied and overwritten in the destination. </p></div><h2>Database synchronization with full refresh append</h2><div><p>In this section you will create an <a>Airbyte connection</a>that reads data from the Postgres source and drives it into the Postgres destination using the <strong>full refresh | append</strong>replication mode. In this mode, as with the <strong>full refresh | overwrite</strong>replication mode, all data in the source database is sent to the destination database, regardless of whether it has been synced before or not. However, in the <strong>append</strong>variant, new syncs will take all data from the most recent sync and append it to the raw destination table. If normalization is enabled, then records that have recently been appended to the raw table will be normalized and appended to the normalized table.

Troubleshooting Postgres Sources | Airbyte Documentation

Documentation Content:
</li><li>The Postgres source connector does not alter the schema present in your database. Depending on the destination connected to this source, however, the schema may be altered. See the destination's documentation for more details.</li><li>The following two schema evolution actions are currently supported:<ul><li>Adding/removing tables without resetting the entire connection at the destination
Caveat: In the CDC mode, adding a new table to a connection may become a temporary bottleneck. When a new table is added, the next sync job takes a full snapshot of the new table before it proceeds to handle any changes.</li><li>Resetting a single table within the connection without resetting the rest of the destination tables in that connection</li></ul></li><li>Changing a column data type or removing a column might break connections.</li></ul><h3>Version Requirements<a>​</a></h3><ul><li>For Airbyte Open Source users, <a>upgrade</a>your Airbyte platform to version <code>v0.58.0</code>or newer</li><li>Use Postgres v9.3.x or above for non-CDC workflows and Postgres v10 or above for CDC workflows</li><li>For Airbyte Cloud (and optionally for Airbyte Open Source), ensure SSL is enabled in your environment</li></ul><h3>CDC Requirements<a>​</a></h3><ul><li>Incremental sync is only supported for tables with primary keys. For tables without primary keys, use <a>Full Refresh sync</a>.</li><li>Data must be in tables and not views. If you require data synchronization from a view, you would need to create a new connection with <code>Standard</code>as <code>Replication Method</code>.</li><li>The modifications you want to capture must be made using <code>DELETE</code>/<code>INSERT</code>/<code>UPDATE</code>. For example, changes made using <code>TRUNCATE</code>/<code>ALTER</code>will not appear in logs and therefore in your destination.</li><li>Schema changes are not supported automatically for CDC sources.
