To search across all attempts, download the logs locally.
Link to a sync job
​
To help others quickly find your job, copy the link to the logs to your clipboard, select the three grey dots next to a sync and select
Copy link to job
.
You can also access the link to a sync job from the in-app log viewer.
Download the logs
​
To download a copy of the logs locally, select the three grey dots next to a sync and select
Download logs
.
You can also access the download log button from the in-app log viewer.
note
If a sync was completed across multiple attempts, downloading the logs will union all the logs for all attempts for that job.
Exploring Local Logs
​
Open Source
only
The following documentation only applies to
Open Source
.
Establish the folder directory
​
In the UI, you can discover the Attempt ID within the sync job. Most jobs will complete in the first attempt, so your folder directory will look like
/tmp/workspace/9/0
. If you sync job completes in multiple attempts, you'll need to define which attempt you're interested in, and note this. For example, for the third attempt, it will look like
/tmp/workspace/9/2/
.
Understanding the Docker run commands
​
We can also read the different docker commands being used internally are starting with:
docker run --rm -i -v airbyte_workspace:/data -v /tmp/airbyte_local:/local -w /data/9/2 --network host ...
From there, we can observe that Airbyte is calling the
-v
option to use a docker named volume called
airbyte_workspace
that is mounted in the container at the location
/data
.
Following
Docker Volume documentation
, we can inspect and manipulate persisted configuration data in these volumes.
Opening a Unix shell prompt to browse the Docker volume
​
For example, we can run any docker container/image to browse the content of this named volume by mounting it similarly. In the example below, the
busybox
image is used.

Next, you can toggle which streams you want to replicate. Our test data consists of three streams, which we've enabled and set to
Incremental - Append + Deduped
sync mode.
Your sync mode is already determined by your selection above, but you can change the sync mode for an individual stream. You can also select a cursor or primary key to enable incremental and/or deduplication. For more information on the nature of each sync mode supported by Airbyte, see
this page
.
You can also select individual fields to sync on this page. Expand the fields available by clicking any stream. This is helpful when you have security concerns or don't want to sync all the data from the source.
Click
Next
to complete your stream setup and move to the connection configuration. This is where you'll set up how often your data will sync and where it will live in the destination. For this demo, we'll set the connection to run at 8 AM every day and sync the connection to a custom namespace with a stream prefix.
note
To ensure your data is synced to the correct place, see our examples for
Destination Namespace
Once you've set up all the connection settings, click "Set up connection". You've successfully set up your first data pipeline with Airbyte. Your first sync is about to begin!
Connection Overview
​
Once you've finished setting up the connection, you will be automatically redirected to a connection overview containing all the tools you need to keep track of your connection.
Here's a basic overview of the tabs and their use:
The
Status
tab shows you an overview of your connector's sync health.
The
Job History
tab allows you to check the logs for each sync. If you encounter any errors or unexpected behaviors during a sync, checking the logs is always a good first step to finding the cause and solution.
The
Schema
tab allows you to modify the streams you chose during the connection setup.
The
Transformation
tab allows you to set up a custom post-sync transformations using dbt.
The
Settings
tab contains the connection settings, and the option to delete the connection if you no longer wish to use it.

Airbyte records the full logs as a part of each sync. These logs can be used to understand the underlying operations Airbyte performs to read data from the source and write to the destination as a part of the
Airbyte Protocol
. The logs includes many details, including any errors that can be helpful when troubleshooting sync errors.
info
When using Airbyte Open Source, you can also access additional logs outside of the UI. This is useful if you need to browse the Docker volumes where extra output files of Airbyte server and workers are stored.
To find the logs for a connection, navigate to a connection's
Job History
tab to see the latest syncs.
View the logs in the UI
​
To open the logs in the UI, select the three grey dots next to a sync and select
View logs
. This will open our full screen in-app log viewer.
tip
If you are troubleshooting a sync error, you can search for
Error
,
Exception
, or
Fail
to find common errors.
The in-app log viewer will only search for instances of the search term within that attempt. To search across all attempts, download the logs locally.

The job history displays information about synced data, such as the amount of data moved, the number of records read and committed, and the total sync time. Reviewing this summary can help you monitor the sync performance and identify any potential issues.
To review the sync history, click a connection in the list to view its sync history. Sync History displays the sync status or
reset
status. The sync status is defined as:
Status
Description
Succeeded
100% of the data has been extracted and loaded to the destination
Partially Succeeded
A subset of the data has been loaded to the destination
Failed
None of the data has been loaded to the destination
Cancelled
The sync was cancelled manually before finishing
Running
The sync is currently running
Sync summary
​
Each sync shows the time the sync was initiated and additional metadata. This information can help in understanding sync performance over time.
Data
Description
x GB (also measured in KB, MB)
Amount of data moved during the sync
x extracted records
Number of records read from the source during the sync
x loaded records
Number of records the destination confirmed it received.
