    "instruction": "I want to setup an Airbyte local environment. The github repository has been downloaded in `~/projects/airbyte/`. Could you help me launch the corresponding homepage at port 8000 (any login email and company will suffice)?\nHere is a step-by-step tutorial from an expert instructing you how to complete it:\nTo setup and launch Airbyte in a local machine:\n1. In the opened terminal, type in the following command to enter the downloaded airbyte folder:\n`cd ~/projects/airbyte`\n2. start the airbyte server via:\n`bash run-ab-platform.sh`\n3. after waiting for roughly 40 seconds, switch to the chromium browser\n4. navigate to url http://localhost:8000, you may see a setup form collecting user information.\n5. since the server is launched in localhost, we can fill in any email and company name, e.g., anonymous@gmail.com and Google\n6. click the \"submit\" button, and after page re-direction, we have successfully logged into the aribyte homepage\nYou can exactly follow the detailed plan above or proactively tackle the task based on the real-time environment interaction by yourself.",
