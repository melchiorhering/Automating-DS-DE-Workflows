Configuring Connections | Airbyte Documentation

Documentation Content:
info
A connection's schema consists of one or many streams. Each stream is most commonly associated with a database table or an API endpoint. Within a stream, there can be one or many fields or columns.
To modify streams, click
Connections
and then click the connection you want to change. Click the
Schema
tab to see all the streams Airbyte can sync. To modify an individual stream:
Toggle
Sync
on or off for your selected stream. To select or deselect all streams at once, use "Hide disabled streams" in the table header. To deselect an individual stream, use the toggle in its row.
Click the
Sync mode
dropdown and select the sync mode you want to apply. Depending on the sync mode you select, you may need to choose a cursor or primary key.
info
Source-defined cursors and primary keys are selected automatically and cannot be changed in the table.
Click on a stream to display the stream details panel. You'll see each column we detect from the source.
Column selection is available to protect PII or sensitive data from being synced to the destination. Toggle individual fields to include or exclude them in the sync, or use the toggle in the table header to select all fields at once.
info
You can only deselect top-level fields. You cannot deselect nested fields.
The Airbyte platform may read all data from the source (depending on the source), but it will only write data to the destination from fields you selected. Deselecting fields will not prevent the Airbyte platform from reading them.
When you refresh the schema, newly added fields will be selected by default, even if you have previously deselected fields in that stream.
Click the
X
to close the stream details panel.
Click
Save changes
, or click
Cancel
to discard the changes.
The
Stream configuration changed
dialog displays. This gives you the option to reset streams when you save the changes.
tip
When editing the stream configuration, Airbyte recommends that you reset streams. A reset will delete data in the destination of the affected streams and then re-sync that data. Skipping a reset is discouraged and might lead to unexpected behavior.

Of note, if you choose
Incremental Sync
, state will be maintained between syncs, and once you hit
count
records, no new records will be added.
You can choose a specific
seed
(integer) as an option for this connector which will guarantee that
the same fake records are generated each time. Otherwise, random data will be created on each
subsequent sync.

Documentation Title:
Jira Migration Guide | Airbyte Documentation

Documentation Content:
This is part of a strategic move to streamline many processes across connectors, bolstering maintainability and freeing us to focus more of our efforts on improving the performance and features of our evolving platform and growing catalog. However, due to differences between the Python and low-code CDKs, this migration constitutes a breaking change.
To gracefully handle these changes for your existing connections, we highly recommend resetting your data before resuming your data syncs with the new version. The
Issues
,
Board Issues
and
Sprint Issues
streams can be manually reset in the following way:
Select
Connections
in the main navbar.
1.1 Select the connection(s) affected by the update.
Select the
Schema
tab.
Uncheck all streams except the affected ones.
Select
Save changes
at the bottom of the page.
Select the
Settings
tab.
Press the
Clear your data
button.
Return to the
Schema
tab.
Check all your streams.
Select
Sync now
to sync your data
For more information on resetting your data in Airbyte, see

.
Upgrading to 1.0.0
​
Note: this change is only breaking if you are using the
Boards Issues
stream in Incremental Sync mode.
This is a breaking change because Stream State for
Boards Issues
will be changed, so please follow the instructions below to migrate to version 1.0.0:
Select
Connections
in the main navbar.
1.1 Select the connection(s) affected by the update.
Select the
Replication
tab.
2.1 Select
Refresh source schema
.
note Any detected schema changes will be listed for your review.
2.2 Select
OK
.
Select
Save changes
at the bottom of the page.
3.1 Ensure the
Reset affected streams
option is checked.
note Depending on destination type you may not be prompted to reset your data
Select
Save connection
.
note This will reset the data in your destination and initiate a fresh sync.
