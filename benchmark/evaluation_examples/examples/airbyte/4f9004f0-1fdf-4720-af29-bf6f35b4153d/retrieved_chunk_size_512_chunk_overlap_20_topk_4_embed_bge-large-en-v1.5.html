Setting Up the dbt Project</h2><p><a>dbt (data build tool)</a>allows you to transform your data by writing, documenting, and executing SQL workflows. Setting up the dbt project requires specifying connection details for your data platform, in this case, BigQuery.</p><h3>1. Navigate to the dbt Project Directory:</h3><p>Move to the dbt project directory in your project's file structure.</p><code>cd ../../dbt_project</code><p>This directory contains all the dbt-related configurations and SQL models.</p><h3>2. Update Connection Details:</h3><p>Within this directory, you'll find a &lt;span class="text-style-code"&gt;profiles.yml file&lt;/span&gt;.

Start by <a>creating new dbt sources</a>to represent this data, allowing for structured transformations down the line.</p><h3><strong>Add Your dbt Transformations</strong>:</h3><p>With your dbt sources in place, you can now build upon them. Add your custom SQL transformations in dbt, ensuring that you treat the sources as an upstream dependency. This ensures that your transformations work on the most up-to-date raw data.</p><h3><strong>Execute the Pipeline in Dagster</strong>:</h3><p>Navigate to the Dagster UI and click on "Materialize all". This triggers the entire pipeline, encompassing the extraction via Airbyte, transformations via dbt, and any other subsequent steps.</p><h3><strong>Explore in Looker</strong>:</h3><p>You can use the SQL Runner to create queries and Explores, create and share Looks (reports and dashboards), or use LookML to create a data model that Looker will use to query your data. However way you wish to go with your Snowflake data, the choice is yours.</p><h3><strong>Extend the Project</strong>:</h3><p>The real beauty of this integration is its extensibility. Whether you want to add more data sources, integrate additional tools, or enhance your transformation logic ‚Äì the floor is yours. With the foundation set, sky's the limit for how you want to extend and refine your data processes.</p></div></div><div><h2>Getting started is easy</h2><p>Start breaking your data siloes with Airbyte</p><div><a>Get Started on Airbyte Cloud</a><div>View repo</div></div></div><div><h2>Similar quickstarts</h2><div><div><p>35 minutes</p><div>Airbyte, dbt, Snowflake and Looker (ADSL) Stack</div></div><div><p>20 minutes</p><div>Shopping Cart Analytics Stack With Shopify, Airbyte, dbt,
