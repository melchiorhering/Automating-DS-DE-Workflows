Once you're done, you can set up the connection as follows.</p><p>As you can see, I set the replication frequency to <em>manual </em>so I can trigger synchronization on demand. You can change the replication frequency, later on, to sync <strong>as frequently as every 5 minutes</strong>.</p><p>Then, it's time to configure the <a>streams</a>, which in this case are the tables in your database. For now, you only have the <em>cars</em>table. If you expand it, you can see the columns it has.</p><p>Now, you should select a sync mode. If you want to take full advantage of performing MySQL CDC, you should use <em>Incremental | Append</em>mode to only look at the rows that have changed in the source and sync them to the destination. Selecting a <em>Full Refresh</em>mode would sync the whole source table, which is most likely not what you want when using CDC. Learn more about sync modes in <a>our documentation</a>.</p><p>When using an <em>Incremental</em>sync mode, you would generally need to provide a <em>Cursor field</em>, but when using CDC, that's not necessary since the changes in the source are detected via the Debezium connector stream.</p><p>Once you're ready, save the changes. Then, you can run your first sync by clicking on <em>Sync now</em>. You can check your run logs to verify everything is going well. Just wait for the sync to be completed, and that's it!

Your database in MySQL is ready to be used.</p></div><div><h3>Should you build or buy your data pipelines?</h3><p>Download our free guide and discover the best approach for your needs, whether it's building your ELT solution in-house or opting for Airbyte Open Source or Airbyte Cloud.</p><div>Download now</div></div><h2>Step 3: Configure a MySQL source in Airbyte</h2><div><p>To set up a new MySQL Airbyte source, go to Airbyte's UI at <a>localhost:8000</a>, click on sources and add a new source. As the connector type, select <em>MySQL</em>. As demonstrated in the subsequent illustrations, fill in the following configuration fields if you used the instructions above to configure your  database in MySQL.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>Then click on <em>Set up source</em>and Airbyte will test the connection. If everything goes well, you should see a successful message.</p></div><h2>Step 4: Configure a local JSON destination in Airbyte</h2><div><p>Now, you’ll configure a local JSON destination in Airbyte. Take into account that I use local JSON as a destination for demonstration purposes – as it’s the easiest to set up. For your actual applications, you can select any destination from our <a>ever-growing catalog</a>. </p><p>Go to destinations and add a new one. As demonstrated in the following diagram, select <em>Local JSON</em>as the destination type and fill in with the following details.</p><p>‍</p><p>Then click on <em>Set up source</em>and let Airbyte test the destination.</p></div><h2>Step 5: Create an Airbyte connection</h2><div><p>Go to connections and create a new connection. Then, select the existing MySQL source you have just created and then do the same for the Local JSON destination.

Just wait for the sync to be completed, and that's it! You've replicated data from MySQL using CDC.</p></div><h2>Step 6: Verify that the sync worked</h2><div><p>From the root directory of the Airbyte project, go to <em>&lt;span class="text-style-code-dark"&gt;tmp/airbyte_local/json_data/&lt;/span&gt;</em>, and you will find a file named <em>&lt;span class="text-style-code-dark"&gt;_airbyte_raw_cars.jsonl&lt;/span&gt;</em>where the data from the MySQL database was replicated.</p><p>You can check the file's contents in your preferred IDE or run the following command.</p><code>cat _airbyte_raw_cars.jsonl
</code><p>‍</p><p>‍</p></div><h2>Step 7: Test CDC in action by creating and deleting an object from the database</h2><div><p>Now, let's test the MySQL CDC setup you have configured. To do that, run the following queries to insert and delete a row from the database.</p><code>INSERT INTO cars VALUES(3, 'tesla');
DELETE FROM cars WHERE NAME = 'tesla';
</code><p>‍</p><p>Launch a sync and, once it finishes, check the local JSON file to verify that CDC has captured the change. The JSON file should now have two new lines, showing the addition and deletion of the row from the database.</p><p>‍</p><p>CDC allows you to see that a row was deleted, which would be impossible to detect when using the regular <em>Incremental</em>sync mode. The <em>&lt;span class="text-style-code-dark"&gt;_ab_cdc_deleted_at&lt;/span&gt;</em>meta field not being <em>null</em>means id=3 was deleted.</p></div><h2>Wrapping up</h2><div><p>In this tutorial, you have learned what the MySQL binlog is and how Airbyte reads it to implement log-based Change Data Capture (CDC).

After specifying the Destination Path, click on Set up destination. </p><figcaption>Configure the Local JSON destination</figcaption><p>‍</p><p>This will take you to a page to set up the connection. Set the replication frequency to <strong>Manual</strong>(since we will use Airflow to trigger Airbyte syncs rather than using Airbyte’s scheduler) and then click on <strong>Set up connection</strong>as highlighted in the image below.</p><figcaption>Specify connection settings</figcaption><p>‍</p><p>Trigger a sync from the <strong>Sample Data (faker)</strong>source to the <strong>Local JSON</strong>output by clicking on <strong>Sync now</strong>as highlighted in the image below.</p><figcaption>Manually trigger a sync from the UI</figcaption><p>‍</p><p>The sync should take a few seconds, at which point you should see that the sync has succeed as shown below.</p><figcaption>After the sync has completed</figcaption><p>‍</p><p>You can now confirm if some sample data has been copied to the expected location. As previously mentioned, for this example the JSON data can be seen in <strong>/tmp/airbyte_local_json_from_faker</strong>. Because there were three streams generated, the following three JSON files should be available: </p><code>_airbyte_raw_products.jsonl	
_airbyte_raw_users.jsonl
_airbyte_raw_purchases.jsonl
</code><p>You have now created a simple example connection in Airbyte which can be manually triggered. A manually triggered connection is ideal for situations where you wish to use an external orchestrator. </p><p>In the next section you will see how to trigger a manual sync on this connection by hitting a REST endpoint directly. After that, you will see how Airflow can be used to hit that same endpoint to trigger synchronizations. </p><h2>Test the API endpoints with cURL</h2><p>Before using the REST endpoint from within Airflow, it is useful to verify that it is working as expected.
