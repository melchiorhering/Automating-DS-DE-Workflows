This will bring you to a screen where you can select your data source. Choose “<a>Postgres</a>” as your source type.</p><p>Now you will be brought to a screen where you need to enter some specific information about your Postgres database. This includes host, port, database name, and a list of the schemas you wish to sync. </p><p>I kept the default port and added my database named `development`, `customers` schema, and the login information for my Airbyte user. It is best practice to <a>create users specific to the tools</a>you are connecting to your database.</p><h3>Set up your Snowflake destination</h3><p>Now let’s set up our <a>Snowflake destination</a>where we will be replicating our Postgres data to. Start by clicking on “new destination” in the top right corner. Then select “Snowflake” as your destination type.</p><p>‍</p><p>This is where you will input the information for the Snowflake database that you are copying your Postgres data. Make sure you enter the right location information! </p><p>I also recommend setting up a role that is specific for loading data in your destination as well. This will help keep your environment secure and all you to closely monitor different metrics on the replication process.</p><h3>Set up a Postgres to Snowflake connection</h3><p>Now that you’ve created both your source in Postgres and your destination in Snowflake, you can set up a connection between the two to replicate your data from Postgres. Select “connections” on the left panel.</p><p>Select your Postgres source you created from the dropdown, then select Snowflake as your destination.</p><p>Now you’ll want to give the connection a good name and choose how often it replicates. I’m going to call mine “postgres_snowflake_replication” and set it t replicate every 24 hours. </p><p>I also recommend selecting “mirror source structure” for the “destination namespace”. This will allow you to easily compare the differences between the source table and the destination table.

In this tutorial I will demonstrate CDC replication only with the incremental dedupe synchronization mode.</p><blockquote>ℹ️ The steps presented in this section could also be used for testing other sync modes.</blockquote><p>Define a new connection that will be used for incremental CDC replication as follows: </p><blockquote>ℹ️  In the definition of a CDC replication connection, notice that a <em>cursor field</em>is not required (as opposed to “standard” <a>incremental replication</a>). Furthermore, the <em>primary key</em>is automatically determined from the source table, and is therefore not selected. </blockquote><p>Once you click on <em>Set up connection</em>, Airbyte will start a sync operation from the source to the destination.
