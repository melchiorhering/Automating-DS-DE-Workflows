    "instruction": "Calculate the total sales in an underneath row called \"Total\" and display the total of each month as bars. Then calculate the growth rate (use decimals) between each pair of months in another row called \"Growth\" and show them in a line chart. Set the chart titles as the two row headers respectively and remove legends.\nHere is a step-by-step tutorial from an expert instructing you how to complete it:\nPlease follow the steps below to calculate the statistics of new rows \"Total\" and \"Growth\", and draw two charts accordingly:\n1. Click cell A12;\n2. Type in text \"Total\";\n3. Click cell B12;\n4. Type in \"=SUM(B2:B11)\" and press ENTER to apply the `SUM` function;\n5. Click cell B12 and move the mouse to the bottom right corner of this cell. We should see a cross symbol;\n6. Press down the mouse and drag right until to column G;\n7. Release the mouse, and all contents from B12 to G12 will be automatically filled;\n8. Click the button \"Insert -> Chart...\" on the top menu bar.\n9. In the pop-up window \"Chart Type\", select \"Bar\" under prompts \"Choose a Chart Type\" in the middle panel.\n10. Click `Data Range` in the left panel;\n11. For input box `Data Range:` on the right panel, type in \"$Sheet1.$B1:$G1,$Sheet1.$B12:$G12\" to overwrite the original content.\n12. Ensure that two radio boxes `Data series in rows` and `First row as label` below (and only these two) are chosen.\n13. Then, click the `Chart Elements` on the left panel;\n14. Type in \"Total\" in the input box named \"Title\" on the right panel;\n15. Uncheck or disable the `Display legend` option on the right side.\n16. Click \"Finish\" button. Now, we have created a bar chart for the total sales of each month;\n17. Next, click cell A13;\n18. Type in text \"Growth\";\n19. Click cell C13;\n20. Type in formula \"=(C12-B12)/B12\" and press ENTER to make it work;\n21. Click cell C13 and move the mouse to the bottom right corner of this cell. We should see a cross symbol;\n22. Press down the mouse and drag right until to column G;\n23. Release the mouse, and all rates from C13 to G13 will be automatically calculated;\n24. Click the button \"Insert -> Chart...\" on the top menu bar.\n25. In the pop-up window \"Chart Type\", select \"Line\" under prompts \"Choose a Chart Type\" in the middle panel.\n26. Click `Data Range` in the left panel;\n27. For input box `Data Range:` on the right panel, type in \"$Sheet1.$C1:$G1,$Sheet1.$C13:$G13\" to overwrite the original content.\n28. Ensure that two radio boxes `Data series in rows` and `First row as label` below (and only these two) are chosen.\n29. Then, click the `Chart Elements` on the left panel;\n30. Type in \"Growth\" in the input box named \"Title\" on the right panel;\n31. Uncheck or disable the `Display legend` option on the right side.\n32. Click \"Finish\" button. Now, we have created another line chart for the growth percentage between each pair of months.\n33. Finally, save the file with Ctrl+S.\nYou can exactly follow the detailed plan above or proactively tackle the task based on the real-time environment interaction by yourself.",
