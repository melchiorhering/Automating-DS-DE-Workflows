I am using Astronomer to deploy Airflow
To build a connection on Airflow and trigger the dag, we can follow the setps:
1. On the opened airflow web page, click the "Admin" button in the top menu bar of the web page;
2. Select "Connections" from the drop-down menu;
3. In the new page, click the blue button "+" below the search bar to create new Connection;
4. In the window "Add Connection", firstly set the category to "HTTP";
5. Next, type in values from config.yaml into the corresponding fields in the form:
   Connection id: http_weather_service, 
   Host: 'wttr.in', 
   Schema: 'https'
6. After filling these fields, click the button "Save" at the bottom of the web page;
7. Then, we will see a new line with name "http_weather_service" in the connection panel.
8. On the Airflow web page, find 'weather_data_dag' in the DAG list and click the slider to the left of the name to Unpause dag; 
9. Click the triangle under the Action column on the far right of the row to trigger the dag; 
10. Wait until the status of all tasks in the 'Runs' column to change to "success" or "failed".
