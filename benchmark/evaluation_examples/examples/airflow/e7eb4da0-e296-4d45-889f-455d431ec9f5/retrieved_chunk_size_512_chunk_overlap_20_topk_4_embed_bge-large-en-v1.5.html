An introduction to the Airflow UI | Astronomer Documentation

Documentation Content:
Here you can find information like total historic runs of a DAG, the data interval start of a DAG run, and the duration of a task instance.</p><p>To access the details of a specific DAG run or task instance, you need first need to select it in the DAG grid as shown in the following gif:</p><p>When you select a task instance in the DAG grid, three additional options appear underneath the tabs:</p><ul><li><strong>More Details:</strong>Shows all attributes of a task, including variables and templates.</li><li><strong>Rendered Template:</strong>Shows the task's metadata after it has been templated.</li><li><strong>List Instances, all runs:</strong>Shows a historical view of task instances and statuses for that particular task.</li></ul><h3>Graph<a>​</a></h3><p>The <strong>Graph</strong>tab shows a  graph visualization of the tasks and dependencies in your DAG, including <a>Airflow datasets</a>a DAG is scheduled on or updates. If you select a task or task group instance in a DAG grid column, the graph highlights and zooms to the selected task. You can also navigate complex DAGs using <strong>Filter Tasks</strong>option and the minimap. This view is useful to explore the DAG structure and task dependencies.</p><div><div>note</div><p>Earlier Airflow versions had a different <strong>Graph</strong>view that was not integrated into the DAG view. See the <a>Airflow documentation of your version</a>for more information.</p></div><h3>Code<a>​</a></h3><p>Under the <strong>Code</strong>tab you can access the code that generates the DAG you are viewing. While your code should live in source control, the <strong>Code</strong>tab provides a quick insight into what is going on in the DAG. DAG code can't be edited in the UI.</p><p>This tab shows code only from the file that generated the DAG.

Airflow logging | Astronomer Documentation

Documentation Content:
To view task logs directly in your terminal, run <code>astro dev run tasks test &lt;dag_id&gt; &lt;task_id&gt;</code>with the <a>Astro CLI</a>or <code>airflow tasks test &lt;dag_id&gt; &lt;task_id&gt;</code>if you are running Airflow with other tools.</li><li>Metadata database: Logs are handled differently depending on which database you use.</li></ul><h3>Docker Airflow environment<a>​</a></h3><p>If you run Airflow in Docker using the <a>Astro CLI</a>or by <a>following the Airflow documentation</a>, you can find the logs for each Airflow component in the following locations:</p><ul><li>Scheduler: Logs are in <code>/usr/local/airflow/logs/scheduler</code>within the scheduler Docker container by default. To enter a docker container in a bash session, run <code>docker exec -it &lt;container_id&gt; /bin/bash</code>.</li><li>Webserver: Logs appear in the console by default. You can access the logs by running <code>docker logs &lt;webserver_container_id&gt;</code>.</li><li>Metadata database: Logs appear in the console by default. You can access the logs by running <code>docker logs &lt;postgres_container_id&gt;</code>.</li><li>Triggerer: Logs appear in the console by default. You can access the logs by running <code>docker logs &lt;triggerer_container_id&gt;</code>. Individual triggers' log messages can be found in the logs of tasks that use deferrable operators.</li><li>Task: Logs appear in <code>/usr/local/airflow/logs/</code>within the scheduler Docker container. To access task logs in the Airflow UI click on the square of a task instance in the Grid views and then select the <strong>Logs</strong>tab.</li></ul><p>The Astro CLI includes a command to show webserver, scheduler, triggerer and Celery worker logs from the local Airflow environment.

Get started with Apache Airflow, Part 1: Write and run your first DAG | Astronomer Documentation

Documentation Content:
This view is useful for seeing DAG runs over time and troubleshooting previously failed task instances.</p><p>Click on a green square to display additional information about the related task instance on the right side of the Airflow UI. The task instance view includes tabs with additional information for the task instance, such as its logs and historic runs. This is one of many available views that show details about your DAG.</p><p>To access information about mapped task instances of a dynamically mapped task, click the green square of the mapping task instance and then click on <strong>[] Mapped task</strong>to view a list of all dynamically mapped task instances. Click on any entry in the list to access information about the dynamically mapped task instance.</p></li><p>In the <strong>Grid</strong>view, click the <strong>Graph</strong>tab. This view shows task dependencies and relationships and can help you troubleshoot dependency issues. When you select a DAG run in the Grid view, the Graph tab shows the last state of each task instance in this DAG run.</p><p>In the <strong>Grid</strong>view, click the <strong>Code</strong>tab to display your DAG source code.
