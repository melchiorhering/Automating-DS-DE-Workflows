Documentation Title:
Get started with Apache Airflow, Part 1: Write and run your first DAG | Astronomer Documentation

Documentation Content:
This view is useful for seeing DAG runs over time and troubleshooting previously failed task instances.
Click on a green square to display additional information about the related task instance on the right side of the Airflow UI. The task instance view includes tabs with additional information for the task instance, such as its logs and historic runs. This is one of many available views that show details about your DAG.
To access information about mapped task instances of a dynamically mapped task, click the green square of the mapping task instance and then click on
[] Mapped task
to view a list of all dynamically mapped task instances. Click on any entry in the list to access information about the dynamically mapped task instance.
In the
Grid
view, click the
Graph
tab. This view shows task dependencies and relationships and can help you troubleshoot dependency issues. When you select a DAG run in the Grid view, the Graph tab shows the last state of each task instance in this DAG run.
In the
Grid
view, click the
Code
tab to display your DAG source code. Viewing code in the Airflow UI helps you confirm which version of your code is currently running on Airflow.
info
While you can view DAG code within the Airflow UI, code edits must be completed in the Python file within the
/dags
folder. The displayed code updates every 30 seconds.
Step 6: Write a new DAG
​
Now that we can run DAGs and navigate the UI, let's write our own DAG and run it.
In this step, you'll write a DAG that:
Retrieves the number of people currently in space from the Airflow XCom table. This table is part of the Airflow metadata database and is used to pass data between tasks and DAGs. The
example_astronauts
DAG already pushed the number of astronauts to XCom when you ran it in
Step 4
.
Prints the number of people currently in space to logs.
Runs a bash statement reacting to the number of people in space.
You'll copy most of the code, trigger the DAG, and then confirm the expected output is returned.

For example,
acti*
returns results that include
action
and
acting
. The string search does not include fuzzy matching, so misspelled strings or incomplete strings without a wildcard,
*
, return zero results.
Time range
: Filter the logs displayed based on time.
Log type
: Filter based on whether the log message is from a scheduler, worker, webserver, or trigger.
View Airflow component logs locally
​
To show logs for your Airflow scheduler, webserver, or triggerer locally, run the following Astro CLI command:
astro dev logs
After you run this command, the most recent logs for these components appear in your terminal window.
By default, running
astro dev logs
shows logs for all Airflow components. To see logs only for a specific component, add any of the following flags to your command:
--scheduler
--webserver
--triggerer
To continue monitoring logs, run
astro dev logs --follow
. The
--follow
flag ensures that the latest logs continue to appear in your terminal window. For more information about this command, see
CLI Command Reference
.
Airflow task logs
​
Airflow task logs can help you troubleshoot a specific task instance that failed or retried. Based on your preference, you can choose to use to access task logs in the Astro UI or the Airflow UI. Both provide filters, search, and download options for task logs and share other information about your DAG performance on the same page.
Task logs for Astro Deployments are retained for 90 days. The task log retention policy is not currently configurable.
You can also access local Airflow task logs in your local
Airflow UI
or
printed to the terminal
.
Airflow task log levels
​
Similar to the Airflow component log levels, task logs might also be associated with one of the following log levels, that you can search or filter with:
Error
Warn
Info
Debug
Critical
View task logs on the Astro UI
​
To access task logs from the Astro UI:
In the Astro UI, select a Workspace.
Click
DAGs
.
Click the DAG you want to view task logs for.
Click a task run in the DAG run grid.
Click the
Logs
tab to switch from
Graph
view.
