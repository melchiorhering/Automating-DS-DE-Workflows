Documentation Title:
About Astro | Astronomer Documentation

Documentation Content:
Astronomer recommends that you create a dedicated Git repository for each Astro project. To run a DAG, you add the DAG to your Astro project and deploy your Astro project to Astro.</p><p>See <a>Run your first DAG with the Astro CLI</a>to create your first Astro project.</p><h3>Astro UI<a>​</a></h3><p>The Astro UI, hosted at <code>https://cloud.astronomer.io</code>, is the primary interface for accessing and managing Astro from your web browser. You can use the Astro UI to:</p><ul><li>Manage users, teams, and permissions.</li><li>Create and configure Deployments, including infrastructure resources and compute.</li><li>View all of your organization's Deployments, DAGs, and tasks in a single place.</li><li>Monitor the health of your Airflow environments with a variety of alerts, logs, and analytics interfaces.</li><li>Stay up to date with the latest Astro features.</li><li>Create and edit DAGs in the Astro Cloud IDE.</li></ul><h3>Deployment<a>​</a></h3><p>An Astro <em>Deployment</em>is an Airflow environment hosted on Astro. It encompasses all core Airflow components, including the Airflow webserver, scheduler, and workers, along with additional tools for reliability and observability. It runs in an isolated Kubernetes namespace in an <a>Astro cluster</a>and has a set of attached resources to run your Airflow tasks.</p><p>Compared to an open source Airflow environment, an Astro Deployment is easy to create, delete, and modify through either the Astro UI or with the Astro CLI. You can <a>fine-tune resources and settings</a>directly from the Astro UI, see metrics and analytics for your DAGs, review your deploy history, and more. The infrastructure required to run a Deployment is managed by Astronomer.</p><p>To run DAGs in a Deployment, you must either deploy an Astro project manually from your local machine or configure an automated deploy process using a third-party CI/CD tool with the Astro CLI. Then, you can open the Airflow UI from the Astro UI and view your DAGs.

Documentation Title:
Migrate to Astro from Google Cloud Composer | Astronomer Documentation

Documentation Content:
You must deploy your project to Astro to test these resources.</p><h2>Step 9: Deploy to Astro<a>​</a></h2><ol><li><p>Run the following command to authenticate to Astro:</p><span>astro login</span></li><li><p>Run the following command to deploy your project</p><span>astro deploy</span><p>This command returns a list of Deployments available in your Workspace and prompts you to pick one.</p></li><p>In the Astro UI, open your Deployment and click <strong>Open Airflow</strong>. Confirm that you can see your deployed DAGs in the Airflow UI.</p></ol><h2>Step 10: Cut over from your source Airflow environment to Astro<a>​</a></h2><p>After you successfully deploy your code to Astro, you need to migrate your workloads from your source Airflow environment to Astro on a DAG-by-DAG basis. Depending on how your workloads are set up, Astronomer recommends letting DAG owners determine the order to migrate and test DAGs.</p><p>You can complete the following steps in the few days or weeks following your migration set up. Provide updates to your Astronomer Data Engineer as they continue to assist you through the process and any solve any difficulties that arise.</p><p>Continue to validate and move your DAGs until you have fully cut over your source Airflow instance.

Documentation Title:
Get started with Apache Airflow, Part 1: Write and run your first DAG | Astronomer Documentation

Documentation Content:
It contains information about your DAGs and is the best place to create and update Airflow connections to third-party data services.</p><p>To access the Airflow UI, open <code>http://localhost:8080/</code>in a browser and log in with <code>admin</code>for both your username and password.</p><p>The default page in the Airflow UI is the <strong>DAGs</strong>page, which shows an overview of all DAGs in your Airflow environment:</p><p>Each DAG is listed with a few of its properties, including tags, owner, previous runs, schedule, timestamp of the last and next run, and the states of recent tasks. Because you haven't run any DAGs yet, the <strong>Runs</strong>and <strong>Recent Tasks</strong>sections are empty. Let's fix that!</p><h2>Step 4: Trigger a DAG run<a>​</a></h2><p>The <code>example_astronauts</code>DAG in your Astro project is a simple ETL pipeline with two tasks:</p><ul><li><code>get_astronauts</code>queries the <a>Open Notify API</a>for information about astronauts currently in space. The task returns the list of dictionaries containing the name and the spacecraft of all astronauts currently in space, which is passed to the second task in the DAG. This tutorial does not explain how to pass data between tasks, but you can learn more about it in the <a>Pass data between tasks</a>guide.</li><li><code>print_astronaut_craft</code>is a task that uses dynamic mapping to create and run a task instance for each Astronaut in space. Each of these tasks prints a statement about its mapped astronaut. Dynamic task mapping is a versatile feature of Airflow that allows you to create a variable number of tasks at runtime. This feature is covered in more depth in the <a>Create dynamic Airflow tasks</a>guide.</li></ul><p>A <strong>DAG run</strong>is an instance of a DAG running on a specific date.
