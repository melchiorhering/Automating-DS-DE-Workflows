View Deployment logs | Astronomer Documentation

This often includes deprecation notices marked as <code>DeprecationWarning</code>. For example, Airflow might recommend that you upgrade your Deployment if there was a change to the Airflow database or task execution logic.</li><li><strong>Info</strong>: Emitted frequently by Airflow to show that a standard scheduler process, such as DAG parsing, has started. These logs are frequent and can contain useful information. If you run dynamically generated DAGs, for example, these logs will show how many DAGs were created per DAG file and how long it took the scheduler to parse each of them.</li></ul><h3>View Airflow component logs in the Astro UI<a>​</a></h3><p>You can access scheduler, triggerer, and task logs in the Astro UI to find the past 24 hours of logs for any Deployment on its <strong>Logs</strong>page.</p><ol><p>In the Astro UI, select a Workspace and then a Deployment.</p><p>Click the <strong>Logs</strong>tab.</p></ol><p>The maximum number of lines returned is 10,000, with 50 results displayed per page. If there are no logs available for a given Deployment, the following message appears:</p><span>No matching events have been recorded in the past 24 hours.</span><p>Typically, this indicates that the Deployment you selected does not currently have any DAGs running.</p><h4>Filter options<a>​</a></h4><p>You can use the following options to specify the types of logs or messages that you want to view.</p><ul><p><strong>String search</strong>: Enter a string, keyword, or phrase to find in your logs. You can also search with suffix wildcards by adding a <code>*</code>to your search query. For example, <code>acti*</code>returns results that include <code>action</code>and <code>acting</code>.

See <a>Troubleshooting connections</a>.</li><li>Is the issue with all DAGs, or is it isolated to one DAG?</li><li>Can you collect the relevant logs?

Make sure that you're using the correct version of the <a>Airflow documentation</a>.</li><li>Can you reproduce the problem in a new local Airflow instance using the <a>Astro CLI</a>?</li></ul><p>Answering these questions will help you narrow down what kind of issue you're dealing with and inform your next steps.</p><div><div>info</div><p>You can debug your DAG code with IDE debugging tools using the <code>dag.test()</code>method. See <a>Debug interactively with dag.test()</a>.</p></div><h2>Airflow is not starting on the Astro CLI<a>​</a></h2><p>The 3 most common ways to run Airflow locally are using the <a>Astro CLI</a>, running a <a>standalone instance</a>, or running <a>Airflow in Docker</a>. This guide focuses on troubleshooting the Astro CLI, which is an open source tool for quickly running Airflow on a local machine.</p><p>The most common issues related to the Astro CLI are:</p><ul><li>The Astro CLI was not correctly installed. Run <code>astro version</code>to confirm that you can successfully run Astro CLI commands. If a newer version is available, consider upgrading.</li><li>The Docker Daemon is not running. Make sure to start Docker Desktop before starting the Astro CLI.</li><li>There are errors caused by custom commands in the Dockerfile, or dependency conflicts with the packages in <code>packages.txt</code>and <code>requirements.txt</code>.</li><li>Airflow components are in a crash-loop because of errors in custom plugins or XCom backends.
