I am using Astronomer to deploy Airflow
To build extra links for task and trigger the dag, we can follow the steps:
1. Click the VS Code editor on the left panel or dock;
2. According to the opened README.md file, we can extract the instructions on completing the plugin file;
3. Switch to the plugin file ‘my_extra_link_plugin’ that is opened in VSCode;
4. We'll now define two base operator links to set external links for the task. Concretely, we'll define two simple http operators pointing to "https://wttr.in/HongKong" and "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP":
ˋˋˋ
# ... Keep the original ˋmy_extra_link_pluginˋ codes
class WTTRWeatherLink(BaseOperatorLink):
    name = "WTTRWeather"

    operators = [SimpleHttpOperator]

    def get_link(self, operator, *, ti_key=None):
        return "https://wttr.in/HongKong"

class HTTPDocsLink(BaseOperatorLink):
    name = "HTTP file"

    operators = [SimpleHttpOperator]

    def get_link(self, operator, *, ti_key=None):
        return "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP"
ˋˋˋ
5. Save the file content and click the terminal on the left pannel, then type in the following command to restart the UI:
`astro dev restart` 
Chromium on the left panel to switch to the opened airflow web page;
6. On the Airflow web page, find "weather_data_dag" in the DAG list and click the slider to the left of the name to Unpause dag; 
7. Click the triangle under the Action column on the far right of the row to trigger the dag; 
8. Wait until the status of all tasks in the 'Runs' column to change to "success" or "failed"
