3. In the pop-up window, click "Restart".
4. Read the output, understand the data, and keep scrolling down to the blank area.
5. Click button "Click to add a cell."
6. Copy the code below to this cell:
```
user_list = ['Education', 'Above/Below 50k']
gb = adult.groupby(by=user_list)
print(gb['Hours/Week'].mean())
```
7. Click the icon "â–¶" for "Run this cell and advance".
8. Use the hotkey "Ctrl+S" to save the result.
