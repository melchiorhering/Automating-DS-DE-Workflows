JupyterLab!!!!!!!!!!

!An extensible environment for interactive and reproducible computing, based on the
Jupyter Notebook and Architecture.

JupyterLabis the next-generation user interface for Project Jupyteroffering
all the familiar building blocks of the classic Jupyter Notebook (notebook,
terminal, text editor, file browser, rich outputs, etc.) in a flexible and
powerful user interface.

JupyterLab can be extended using npmpackages
that use our public APIs. The *prebuilt*extensions can be distributed
via PyPI,
conda, and other package managers. The *source*extensions can be installed
directly from npm (search for jupyterlab-extension) but require an additional build step.
You can also find JupyterLab extensions exploring GitHub topic jupyterlab-extension.
To learn more about extensions, see the user documentation.

Read the current JupyterLab documentation on ReadTheDocs.

Getting startedInstallationIf you use conda, mamba, or pip, you can install JupyterLab with one of the following commands.

* If you use conda:
```
conda install-cconda-forgejupyterlabCopy
```
* If you use mamba:
```
mamba install-cconda-forgejupyterlabCopy
```
* If you use pip:
```
pip installjupyterlabCopy
```
If installing using `pip install --user`, you must add the user-level `bin`directory to your `PATH`environment variable in order to launch `jupyter lab`. If you are using a Unix derivative (e.g., FreeBSD, GNU/Linux, macOS), you can do this by running `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"`. If you are using a macOS version that comes with Python 2, run `pip3`instead of `pip`.

For more detailed instructions, consult the installation guide. Project installation instructions from the git sources are available in the contributor documentation.

Installing with Previous Versions of Jupyter NotebookWhen using a version of Jupyter Notebook earlier than 5.3, the following command must be run after installing JupyterLab to enable the JupyterLab server extension:
