Documentation Title:
Quickstart with dbt Mesh | dbt Developer Hub

Documentation Content:
This guide uses the Jaffle Shop sample data, including
customers
,
orders
, and
payments
tables. Follow the provided instructions to load this data into your respective data platform:
Snowflake
Databricks
Redshift
BigQuery
Fabric
Starburst Galaxy
This guide assumes you have experience with or fundamental knowledge of dbt. Take the
dbt Fundamentals
course first if you are brand new to dbt.
Create and configure two projects
​
In this section, you'll create two new, empty projects in dbt Cloud to serve as your foundational and downstream projects:
Foundational projects
(or upstream projects) typically contain core models and datasets that serve as the base for further analysis and reporting.
Downstream projects
build on these foundations, often adding more specific transformations or business logic for dedicated teams or purposes.
For example, the always-enterprising and fictional account "Jaffle Labs" will create two projects for their data analytics and finance team: Jaffle | Data Analytics and Jaffle | Finance.
Create two new dbt Cloud projects named 'Jaffle | Data Analytics' and 'Jaffle Finance'
To
create
a new project in dbt Cloud:
From
Account settings
, click
+ New Project
.
Enter a project name and click
Continue
.
Use "Jaffle | Data Analytics" for one project
Use "Jaffle | Finance" for the other project
Select your data platform, then
Next
to set up your connection.
In the
Configure your environment
section, enter the
Settings
for your new project.
Click
Test Connection
. This verifies that dbt Cloud can access your data platform account.
Click
Next
if the test succeeded. If it fails, you might need to go back and double-check your settings.
For this guide, make sure you create a single
development
and
Deployment
per project.
For "Jaffle | Data Analytics", set the default database to
jaffle_da
.
For "Jaffle | Finance", set the default database to
jaffle_finance
Navigate to 'Account settings' and then click + 'New Project' to create new projects in dbt Cloud
