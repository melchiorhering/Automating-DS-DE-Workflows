For more information, see
Format 1 (preferred): Account name in your organization
.
<user_name>
is the login name for your Snowflake user.
Note
If your account has an identity provider (IdP) that has been defined for your account, you can use a web browser to authenticate instead of a password, as the following example demonstrates:
$
snowsql
-a
<account_identifier>
-u
<user_name>
--authenticator
externalbrowser
Copy
For more information, see
Using a web browser for federated authentication/SSO
.
When SnowSQL prompts you, enter the password for your Snowflake user.
If you log in successfully, SnowSQL displays a command prompt that includes
your current warehouse, database, and schema.
Note
If you get locked out of the account and can’t obtain the account identifier, you can find it in the Welcome email that Snowflake sent to
you when you signed up for the trial account, or you can work with your
ORGADMIN to
get the account details
.
You can also find the values for
locator
,
cloud
, and
region
in the Welcome email.
If your Snowflake user doesn’t have a default warehouse, database, and schema, or if
you didn’t configure SnowSQL to specify a default warehouse, database, and schema,
the prompt displays
no
warehouse
,
no
database
, and
no
schema
. For example:
user-name#(no warehouse)@(no database).(no schema)>
Copy
This prompt indicates that there is no warehouse, database, and schema
selected for the current session. You create these objects
in the next step. As you follow the next steps in this tutorial to create
these objects, the prompt automatically updates to include the names of these objects.
For more information, see
Connecting through SnowSQL
.
Create Snowflake objects
¶
During this step you create the following Snowflake objects:
A database (
sf_tuts
) and a table (
emp_basic
). You load sample data into this table.
A
virtual warehouse
(
sf_tuts_wh
).
This warehouse provides the compute resources needed to load data into
the table and query the table. For this tutorial, you create an X-Small warehouse.

Documentation Content:
Optional.
#rolename = <string>      # Default role. Optional.
#authenticator = <string> # Authenticator: 'snowflake', 'externalbrowser' (to use any IdP and a web browser),  https://<okta_account_name>.okta.com (to use Okta natively), 'oauth' to authenticate using OAuth.
Copy
Attention
The password is stored in plain text in the
config
file. You must explicitly secure the file to restrict access. For example, in Linux or macOS, you can set the read permissions to you
alone by running
chmod
:
$
chmod
700
~/.snowsql/config
Copy
If your password includes special characters, you must enclose the password in either single quotes or double quotes.
Verifying the network connection to Snowflake with SnowCD
¶
After configuration, you can evaluate and troubleshoot your network connectivity to Snowflake using
SnowCD
.
You can use SnowCD during the initial configuration process and on-demand at any time to evaluate and troubleshoot your network connection to Snowflake.
Using named connections
¶
To make multiple simultaneous connections to Snowflake, or to simply store different sets of connection configurations, you can define one or more
named
connections.
Defining named connections in the configuration file
¶
Open the
config
configuration file in a text editor. By default, the file is located in:
Linux/macOS
:
~/.snowsql/
Windows
:
%USERPROFILE%\.snowsql\
Add a separate
[connections]
section with a unique name for each named connection.
For example, the following illustrates a connection named
my_example_connection
for a Snowflake account with the
account identifier
myorganization-myaccount
:
[
connections.my_example_connection
]
accountname
=
myorganization-myaccount
username
=
jsmith
password
=
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
dbname
=
mydb
schemaname
=
public
warehousename
=
mywh
Copy
Connecting to Snowflake using a named connection
¶
Use the
-c
<string>
(or
--connection
<string>
) connection parameter to specify a named connection, where
<string>
is the name of a connection defined in the
configuration file
.

Documentation Title:
Create users and grant roles | Snowflake Documentation

Documentation Content:
For DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE, use
COMPUTE_WH
.
CREATE
OR
REPLACE
USER
snowman
PASSWORD
=
'sn0wf@ll'
LOGIN_NAME
=
'snowstorm'
FIRST_NAME
=
'Snow'
LAST_NAME
=
'Storm'
EMAIL
=
'snow.storm@snowflake.com'
MUST_CHANGE_PASSWORD
=
true
DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE
=
COMPUTE_WH
;
Copy
This command returns the following output:
User SNOWMAN successfully created.
If you were creating a real user in a real Snowflake account, you would now send the
following information in a secure manner to the person who would need to access
this new account:
Snowflake Account URL: the Snowflake account link where the user will log in.
You can find this link at the top of your browser
(for example:
https://app.snowflake.com/myorg/myaccount/
,
where
myorg
is the Snowflake organization ID, and
myaccount
is the account ID).
LOGIN_NAME, as specified in the CREATE USER command.
PASSWORD, as specified in the CREATE USER command.
Step 5. Grant a system role and warehouse access to the user
¶
Now that you have created a user, you can use the SECURITYADMIN role to grant the
SYSADMIN role to the user, as well as grant USAGE on the COMPUTE_WH warehouse.
Granting a role to another role creates a parent-child relationship between the roles
(also referred to as a role hierarchy). Granting a role to a user enables the user to perform
all operations allowed by the role (through the access privileges granted to the role).
The SYSADMIN role has privileges to create warehouses, databases, and database objects
in an account and grant those privileges to other roles. Only grant this role to users who should
have these privileges. For information about other system-defined roles, see
see
Overview of Access Control
.
To grant the user access to a role and a warehouse, do the following:
In the open worksheet, place your cursor in the
USE ROLE
line,
then select
Run
.
USE
ROLE
SECURITYADMIN
;
Copy
Place your cursor in the
GRANT ROLE
line, enter the name of the user you created,
then select
Run
.

Documentation Title:
Snowflake in 20 minutes | Snowflake Documentation

Documentation Content:
To set up Snowflake for this tutorial, complete the following before continuing:
Create a user
To create the database, table, and virtual warehouse, you must be logged in as a
Snowflake user with a role that grants you the privileges to create these objects.
If you’re using a 30-day trial account, you can log in as the user that was created for the account.
This user has the role with the privileges needed to create the objects.
If you don’t have a Snowflake user, you can’t perform this tutorial.
If you don’t have a role that lets you create a user, ask someone who does to perform this step for you.
Users with the ACCOUNTADMIN or SECURITYADMIN role can create users.
Install SnowSQL
To install SnowSQL, see
Installing SnowSQL
.
Download sample data files
For this tutorial you download sample employee data files in CSV format that Snowflake provides.
To download and unzip the sample data files:
Download the set of sample data files. Right-click the name of the archive
file,
getting-started.zip
, and save the link/file to your local file system.
Unzip the sample files. The tutorial assumes you unpacked files into one of the following directories:
Linux/macOS:
/tmp
Windows:
C:\\temp
Each file has five data records. The data uses a comma (,) character as field
delimiter. The following is an example record:
Althea,Featherstone,afeatherstona@sf_tuts.com,"8172 Browning Street, Apt B",Calatrava,7/12/2017
Copy
There are no blank spaces before or after the commas separating the
fields in each record. This is the default that Snowflake expects when loading CSV data.
Log in to SnowSQL
¶
After you have
SnowSQL
, start SnowSQL to connect to Snowflake:
Open a command line window.
Start SnowSQL:
$
snowsql
-a
<account_identifier>
-u
<user_name>
Copy
Where:
<account_identifier>
is the unique identifier for your Snowflake account.
The preferred format of the
account identifier
is as follows:
organization_name
-
account_name
Names of your Snowflake organization and account.
