)<a>​</a></h2><p>Setting things up to squeeze an "hello world" into any part of Superset should be as simple as</p><span><span>docker-compose</span><span>up</span></span><p>Note that:</p><ul><li>this will pull/build docker images and run a cluster of services, including:<ul><li>A Superset <strong>Flask web server</strong>, mounting the local python repo/code</li><li>A Superset <strong>Celery worker</strong>, also mounting the local python repo/code</li><li>A Superset <strong>Node service</strong>, mounting, compiling and bundling the JS/TS assets</li><li>A Superset <strong>Node websocket service</strong>to power the async backend</li><li><strong>Postgres</strong>as the metadata database and to store example datasets, charts and dashboards whic
should be populated upon startup</li><li><strong>Redis</strong>as the message queue for our async backend and caching backend</li></ul></li><li>It'll load up examples into the database upon first startup</li><li>all other details and pointers available in
<a>docker-compose.yml</a></li><li>The local repository is mounted withing the services, meaning updating
the code on the host will be reflected in the docker images</li><li>Superset is served at localhost:8088/</li><li>You can login with admin/admin</li></ul><div><div>caution</div><p>Since <code>docker-compose</code>is primarily designed to run a set of containers on <strong>a single host</strong>and can't credibly support <strong>high availability</strong>as a result, we do not support nor recommend
using our <code>docker-compose</code>constructs to support production-type use-cases. For single host
environments, we recommend using <a>minikube</a>along
our <a>installing on k8s</a>documentation.

then clone it.</p><p>Second, you can clone the main repository directly, but you won't be able to send pull requests.</p><code><span><span>git</span><span>clone git@github.com:your-username/superset.git</span></span><span><span>cd</span><span>superset</span></span></code><h2>docker-compose (recommended!
