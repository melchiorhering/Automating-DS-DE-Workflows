Run Query to see the new chart,
which has an additional series with the same values, shifted a week back in time.</p><p>Then, change the <strong>Calculation type</strong>to Absolute difference and select <strong>Run Query</strong>. We can now
see only one series again, this time showing the difference between the two series we saw
previously.</p><p>Save the chart as Tutorial Time Comparison and add it to the Tutorial Dashboard.</p><h3>Resampling the data<a>​</a></h3><p>In this section, we’ll resample the data so that rather than having daily data we have weekly data.
As in the previous section, reopen the Tutorial Advanced Analytics Base chart.</p><p>Next, in the Python Functions subsection of <strong>Advanced Analytics</strong>, enter 7D, corresponding to seven
days, in the Rule and median as the Method and show the chart by selecting <strong>Run Query</strong>.</p><p>Note that now we have a single data point every 7 days. In our case, the value showed corresponds to
the median value within the seven daily data points. For more information on the meaning of the
various options in this section, refer to the
<a>Pandas documentation</a>.</p><p>Lastly, save your chart as Tutorial Resample and add it to the Tutorial Dashboard.

Publish this chart
to your existing Tutorial Dashboard you created earlier.</p><h3>Line Chart<a>​</a></h3><p>In this section, we are going to create a line chart to understand the average price of a ticket by
month across the entire dataset.</p><p>In the Time section, as before, keep the Time Column as Travel Date and Time Grain as month but this
time for the Time range select No filter as we want to look at entire dataset.</p><p>Within Metrics, remove the default <code>COUNT(*)</code>metric and instead add <code>AVG(Cost)</code>, to show the mean value.</p><p>Next, select <strong>Run Query</strong>to show the data on the chart.</p><p>How does this look? Well, we can see that the average cost goes up in December. However, perhaps it
doesn’t make sense to combine both single and return tickets, but rather show two separate lines for
each ticket type.</p><p>Let’s do this by selecting Ticket Single or Return in the Group by box, and the selecting <strong>Run
Query</strong>again. Nice! We can see that on average single tickets are cheaper than returns and that the
big spike in December is caused by return tickets.</p><p>Our chart is looking pretty good already, but let’s customize some more by going to the Customize
tab on the left hand pane. Within this pane, try changing the Color Scheme, removing the range
filter by selecting No in the Show Range Filter drop down and adding some labels using X Axis Label
and Y Axis Label.</p><p>Once you’re done, publish the chart in your Tutorial Dashboard.</p><h3>Markup<a>​</a></h3><p>In this section, we will add some text to our dashboard. If you’re there already, you can navigate
to the dashboard by selecting Dashboards on the top menu, then Tutorial dashboard from the list of
dashboards. Got into edit mode by selecting <strong>Edit dashboard</strong>.</p><p>Within the Insert components pane, drag and drop a Markdown box on the dashboard.

Select <strong>Run Query</strong>to show the
chart. You should see the total cost per day for each month in October 2011.</p><p>Finally, save the visualization as Tutorial Advanced Analytics Base, adding it to the Tutorial
Dashboard.</p><h3>Rolling Mean<a>​</a></h3><p>There is quite a lot of variation in the data, which makes it difficult to identify any trend. One
approach we can take is to show instead a rolling average of the time series. To do this, in the
<strong>Moving Average</strong>subsection of <strong>Advanced Analytics</strong>, select mean in the <strong>Rolling</strong>box and
enter 7 into both Periods and Min Periods. The period is the length of the rolling period expressed
as a multiple of the Time Grain. In our example, the Time Grain is day, so the rolling period is 7
days, such that on the 7th October 2011 the value shown would correspond to the first seven days of
October 2011. Lastly, by specifying Min Periods as 7, we ensure that our mean is always calculated
on 7 days and we avoid any ramp up period.</p><p>After displaying the chart by selecting <strong>Run Query</strong>you will see that the data is less variable
and that the series starts later as the ramp up period is excluded.</p><p>Save the chart as Tutorial Rolling Mean and add it to the Tutorial Dashboard.</p><h3>Time Comparison<a>​</a></h3><p>In this section, we will compare values in our time series to the value a week before. Start off by
opening the Tutorial Advanced Analytics Base chart, by going to <strong>Charts</strong>in the top menu and then
selecting the visualization name in the list (alternatively, find the chart in the Tutorial
Dashboard and select Explore chart from the menu for that visualization).</p><p>Next, in the Time Comparison subsection of <strong>Advanced Analytics</strong>, enter the Time Shift by typing in
“minus 1 week” (note this box accepts input in natural language).

By the
end of this section, you will have created a table that shows the monthly spend on flights for the
first six months, by department, by travel class.</p><p>Create a new chart by selecting <strong>+ ‣ Chart</strong>from the top right corner. Choose
tutorial_flights again as a datasource, then click on the visualization type to get to the
visualization menu. Select the <strong>Pivot Table</strong>visualization (you can filter by entering text in the
search box) and then <strong>Create New Chart</strong>.</p><p>In the <strong>Time</strong>section, keep the Time Column as Travel Date (this is selected automatically as we
only have one time column in our dataset). Then select Time Grain to be month as having daily data
would be too granular to see patterns from. Then select the time range to be the first six months of
2011 by click on Last week in the Time Range section, then in Custom selecting a Start / end of 1st
January 2011 and 30th June 2011 respectively by either entering directly the dates or using the
calendar widget (by selecting the month name and then the year, you can move more quickly to far
away dates).</p><p>Next, within the <strong>Query</strong>section, remove the default COUNT(*) and add Cost, keeping the default
SUM aggregate. Note that Apache Superset will indicate the type of the metric by the symbol on the
left hand column of the list (ABC for string, # for number, a clock face for time, etc.).</p><p>In <strong>Group by</strong>select <strong>Time</strong>: this will automatically use the Time Column and Time Grain
selections we defined in the Time section.</p><p>Within <strong>Columns</strong>, select first Department and then Travel Class. All set – let’s <strong>Run Query</strong>to
see some data!</p><p>You should see months in the rows and Department and Travel Class in the columns.
