In this task, we will create our first Dagster asset `top10_story_ids` in the opened project, which will download the top 10 story ids from Hacker News. Specifically,
1. Switch to the VS Code editor and open the python file `hacker_news/assets.py`;
2. Type in the following code into this empty file:
```
import json
import os

import requests
from dagster import asset # import the `dagster` library

@asset # add the asset decorator to tell Dagster this is an asset
def top10_story_ids() -> None:
    newstories_url = "https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/topstories.json"
    top_story_ids = requests.get(newstories_url).json()[:10]

    os.makedirs("data", exist_ok=True)
    with open("data/story_ids.json", "w") as f:
        json.dump(top_story_ids, f)
```
3. Press the hot key "Ctrl+S" to save the file content. Now, the first asset has been created.
