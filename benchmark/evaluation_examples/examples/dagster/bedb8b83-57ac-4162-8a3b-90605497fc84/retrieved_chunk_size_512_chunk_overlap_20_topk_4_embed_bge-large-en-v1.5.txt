Verify generated components in Airbyte UI
Let's look at the Airbyte UI before we apply anything.
Before I applied the changes, only my manual added connections.
After applying the changes, <span class="text-style-code">fetch_stargazer</span> popped up with its corresponding GitHub source and Postgres destination.
After we applied the Dagster Python configurations
üìù This is equivalent to going into the Airbyte UI and setting up the source and destination with clicks.
Set up Dagster Software Defined Assets
Software-Defined Asset
in Dagster treats each of our destination tables from Airbyte as a
Data Product
‚Äîenabling the control plane to see the latest status of each
Data Asset
and its valuable metadata.
We can set them up with a little bit of code in Dagster. As we created the Airbyte components with Dagster already, Dagster has all the information already:
airbyte_assets = load_assets_from_connections(
    airbyte=airbyte_instance,
    connections=[stargazer_connection],
    key_prefix=["postgres"],
)
The same we do for our dbt project that is under
dbt_transformation
.

Documentation Title:
Migrating Airflow to Dagster | Dagster Docs

Documentation Content:
You can configure your persistent Airflow database by providing an
airflow_db
to the
resource_defs
parameter of the
dagster-airflow
APIs:
from
dagster_airflow
import
(
make_dagster_definitions_from_airflow_dags_path
,
make_persistent_airflow_db_resource
,
)
postgres_airflow_db
=
"postgresql+psycopg2://airflow:airflow@localhost:5432/airflow"
airflow_db
=
make_persistent_airflow_db_resource
(
uri
=
postgres_airflow_db
)
definitions
=
make_dagster_definitions_from_airflow_example_dags
(
'/path/to/dags/'
,
resource_defs
=
{
"airflow_db"
:
airflow_db
}
)
Step 7: Move to production
#
This step is applicable to Dagster+. If deploying to your infrastructure, refer to the
Deployment guides
for more info.
Additionally, until your Airflow DAGs execute successfully in your local environment, we recommend waiting to move to production.
In this step, you'll set up your project for use with Dagster+.
Complete the steps in the
Dagster+ Getting Started guide
, if you haven't already. Proceed to the next step when your account is set up and you have the
dagster-cloud
CLI installed.
In the root of your project, create or modify the
dagster_cloud.yaml
file
with the following code:
locations
:
-
location_name
:
dagster_migration
code_source
:
python_file
:
dagster_migration.py
Push your code and let the CI/CD for Dagster+ run out a deployment of your migrated DAGs to cloud.
Step 8: Migrate permissions to Dagster
#
Your Airflow instance likely had specific IAM or Kubernetes permissions that allowed it to successfully run your Airflow DAGs. To run the migrated Dagster jobs, you'll need to duplicate these permissions for Dagster.
We recommend using
Airflow connections
or
environment variables
to define permissions whenever possible.
If you're unable to use Airflow connections or environment variables,
you can attach permissions directly to the infrastructure where you're deploying Dagster.

The output might look something like this:

4. Orchestrating with Dagster
Dagster
is a modern data orchestrator designed to help you build, test, and monitor your data workflows. In this section, we'll walk you through setting up Dagster to oversee both the Airbyte and dbt workflows:
Navigate to the Orchestration Directory
:
Switch to the directory containing the Dagster orchestration configurations:
cd ../orchestration
Set Environment Variables
:
Dagster requires certain environment variables to be set to interact with other tools like dbt and Airbyte. Set the following variables:
export DAGSTER_DBT_PARSE_PROJECT_ON_LOAD=1
export AIRBYTE_PASSWORD=password
Note: The AIRBYTE_PASSWORD is set to password as a default for local Airbyte instances. If you've changed this during your Airbyte setup, ensure you use the appropriate password here.
Launch the Dagster UI
:
With the environment variables in place, kick-start the Dagster UI:
dagster dev
Access Dagster in Your Browser
:
Open your browser and navigate to
http://127.0.0.1:3000
. There, you should see assets for both Airbyte and dbt. To get an overview of how these assets interrelate, click on "view global asset lineage". This will give you a clear picture of the data lineage, visualizing how data flows between the tools.
Next Steps
Once you've set up and launched this initial integration, the real power lies in its adaptability and extensibility. Here‚Äôs a roadmap to help you customize and harness this project tailored to your specific data needs:
Add more Data(base) sources
:
You can add more databases or data sources from Airbyte's
source catalogue
. To do this, edit the Terraform source_databases module and create a new connection in the connections module for each source added.
Create dbt Sources for Airbyte Data
:
Your raw data extracted via Airbyte can be represented as sources in dbt. Start by
creating new dbt sources
to represent this data, allowing for structured transformations down the line.
Add Your dbt Transformations
:
With your dbt sources in place, you can now build upon them.
