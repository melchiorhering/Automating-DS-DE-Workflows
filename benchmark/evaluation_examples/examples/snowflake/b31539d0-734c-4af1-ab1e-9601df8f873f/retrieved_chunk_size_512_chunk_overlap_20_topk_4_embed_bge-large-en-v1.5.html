See <span>Querying data using worksheets</span>and <span>Visualizing worksheet data</span>.
You can also write Snowpark Python in worksheets. See <span>Writing Snowpark Code in Python Worksheets</span>.</p><p>Manage your worksheets by organizing them into folders, share worksheets with colleagues that also use Snowflake, and
manage the version history for worksheets.

If you don’t see any worksheets, you might need to import
worksheets from the Classic Console. See <span>Import worksheets from the Classic Console</span>.</p><p>Using the options, you can view recent worksheets opened by you, worksheets that your colleagues have shared with you,
worksheets that you created and own, or folders you created or that your colleagues have shared with you.</p><p>For any worksheet or worksheet folder, you can review the title, roughly when the worksheet or folder was last viewed or updated,
and the role associated with the worksheet or folder. In each row, you can see the initials of the user that owns the worksheet or folder.
