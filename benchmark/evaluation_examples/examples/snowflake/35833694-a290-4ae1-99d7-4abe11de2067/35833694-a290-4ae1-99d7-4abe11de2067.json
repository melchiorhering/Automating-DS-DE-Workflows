    "instruction": "I need to count the average wind speed per year based on the data in .csv on the desktop and use the dashboard on snowsight to show the graphical results. You need to create database WIND_DB and upload data into table WIND on the current snowflake website. Then create a dashboard named wind_dashboard, write the code and move the sql worksheet to this dashboard. The result of the execution of the sql commands needs to be YEAR and AVG_WIND_SPEED. Finally, you need to download the query result and name it avg_wind_speed.csv. You also need to download the corresponding bar chart and name it avg_speed_chart.png. Note, return to the dashboard site after downloading as I need to use it later.\nHere is a step-by-step tutorial from an expert instructing you how to complete it:\nThis task covers the whole process of uploading data, querying, and displaying the query results using dashboard on snowsight, which is complex and has many steps.\n- Create database and upload data\n1. Click \"Data >> Database\" on the left menu panel.\n2. Click \"+ Databse\" button on the right;\n3. In the Name field of pop-up window, type in the database name \"WIND_DB\"; \n4. Click \"Create\" button;\n5. In the middle panel, choose entry \"WIND_DB >> PUBLIC\" to select this default schema; If there is not a \"WIND_DB\" entry, click \"...\" on the top-right of this panel and click \"refresh\" on the drop-down menu. \n6. In the right panel, click the \"Create >> Table >> From File\" sequentially.\n7. In the pop-up window, click \"Browse\" and select the \"wind_dataset.csv\" file on Desktop.\n8. Scroll down to the input field with name \"Name\", type in the table name \"WIND\".\n9. Click the button \"Load\" at the bottom right in this window to load all data.\n10. After waiting for a few seconds, we will see the system message \"Successfully Loaded Data\". Click \"Done\" button.\n\n- Query\n1. Click \"Projects >> Worksheets\" on the left menu panel.\n2. Click \"+\" button on the right;\n3. In the drop-down menu, select \"SQL Worksheet\".\n4. In the top of the worksheet, there is a button showing \"No database selected\", click this button.\n5. In the drop-down menu, select \"WIND_DB\" for the database, \"PUBLIC\" for the schema, then click anywhere to turn off the menu.\n6. Copy the code below to the worksheet:\n\nSELECT SUBSTR(DATE, 1, 4) AS year, AVG(WIND) AS avg_wind_speed\nFROM WIND\nGROUP BY year\n\n7. Click \"Run\" button on the top-right.\n\n- Display results using dashboard\n1. In the left panel, find your new created worksheet. Click \"...\" on the right.\n2. In the drop-down menu, select \"Move >> + New Dashboard\" sequentially.\n3. In the pop-up window, type in the dashboard name \"wind_dashboard\" to the input field with name \"Dashboard name\".\n4. Click \"Create Dashboard\".\n5. In the top-right of the dashboard, click \"...\".\n6. In the drop-down menu, select \"View Table\".\n7. Click \"Download results\" on the top-right.\n8. In the drop-down menu, select \"Download as .csv\".\n9. In the middle of the panel, Click \"Chart\".\n10. In the right of the panel, Select \"Bar\" for the Chart type.\n11. Click \"Download chart\" on the top-right.\n12. Click \"Return to wind_dashboard\" on the top-left.\n13. In your virtual machine, navigate to the /home/user/Download directory and rename the downloaded .csv file to \"avg_wind_speed.csv\". Also, rename the downloaded .png file to \"avg_speed_chart.png\".\n14. Return to the chromium.\nYou can exactly follow the detailed plan above or proactively tackle the task based on the real-time environment interaction by yourself.",
