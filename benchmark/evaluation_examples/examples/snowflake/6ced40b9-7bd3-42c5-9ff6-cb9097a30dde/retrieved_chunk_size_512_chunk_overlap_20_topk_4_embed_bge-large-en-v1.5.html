To retrieve results reliably, use filters to reduce
the time it takes to retrieve results to under 15 seconds.</p></div><section><h3>Privileges required to view Query History<a>¶</a></h3><p>You can always view history for queries that you have run.</p><p>To view history for other queries, your active role affects what else you can see in <span>Query History</span>:</p><ul><p>If your active role is the ACCOUNTADMIN role, you can view all query history for the account.</p><p>If your active role has the MONITOR or OPERATE privilege granted on a warehouse, you can view queries run by other users that
use that warehouse.</p><p>If your active role is granted the GOVERNANCE_VIEWER database role for the SNOWFLAKE database, you can view the query history for all
users in your account. See <span>SNOWFLAKE database roles</span>.</p><p>If your active role is granted the READER_USAGE_VIEWER database role for the SNOWFLAKE database, you can view the query history for all
users in reader accounts associated with your account. See <span>SNOWFLAKE database roles</span>.</p></ul></section><section><h3>Considerations for using Query History<a>¶</a></h3><p>When reviewing the <span>Query History</span>for your account, consider the following:</p><ul><p>Details for queries executed more than 7 days ago do not include <span>User</span>information due to the data retention policy for
<span>sessions</span>. You can use the user filter to retrieve queries run by individual users.
See <span>Filter Query History</span>.</p><p>For queries that failed due to syntax or parsing errors, you see <span>&lt;redacted&gt;</span>instead of the SQL statement that was executed.
If you are granted a role with appropriate privileges, you can set the <span>ENABLE_UNREDACTED_QUERY_SYNTAX_ERROR</span>parameter to view
the full query text.</p><p>Filters and the <span>Started</span>and <span>End Time</span>columns use your current time zone.
