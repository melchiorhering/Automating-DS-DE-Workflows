Documentation Title:
Monitor query activity with Query History | Snowflake Documentation

Documentation Content:
Use filters to help ensure reliable results.
You can filter by the following:
Status of the query, for example to identify long-running queries, failed queries, and queued queries.
User who performed the query, including:
All
, to see all users for which you have access to view query history.
The user you are signed in as (default)
Individual Snowflake users in your account, if your role can view query history for other users.
Time period during which the query was run, up to 14 days.
Other filters, including the following:
SQL Text
, for example, to view queries that use specific statements, such as GROUP BY.
Query ID
, to view details for a specific query.
Warehouse
,  to view queries that were run using a specific warehouse.
Statement Type
, to view queries that used a specific type of statement, such as DELETE, UPDATE, INSERT, or SELECT.
Duration
, for example, to identify especially long-running queries.
Session ID
, to view queries run during a specific Snowflake session.
Query Tag
, to view queries with a specific query tag set through the
QUERY_TAG
session parameter.
Client generated statements
, to view internal queries run by a client, driver, or library, including the web interface.
For example, whenever a user navigates to the
Warehouses
page in Snowsight, Snowflake executes a SHOW WAREHOUSES
statement in the background. That statement would be visible when this filter is enabled. Your account is not billed for
client-generated statements.
Queries executed by user tasks
, to view SQL statements executed or stored procedures called by user tasks.
Show replication refresh history
, to view queries used to perform
replication
refresh tasks to remote regions and accounts.
If you want to see near-real-time results, enable
Auto Refresh
. When
Auto Refresh
is enabled, the table refreshes every ten seconds.
You can see the following columns in the
Queries
table by default:
SQL Text
, the text of the executed statement (always shown).
Query ID
, the ID of the query (always shown).
Status
, the status of the executed statement (always shown).
User
, to see the username that executed a statement.
Warehouse
, to see the warehouse used to execute a statement.

Documentation Content:
Note
You might see incomplete or no results when you use the
Query History
page. This is because the page spends a maximum of 15 seconds
retrieving results and returns whatever query information is available at that time. To retrieve results reliably, use filters to reduce
the time it takes to retrieve results to under 15 seconds.
Privileges required to view Query History
¶
You can always view history for queries that you have run.
To view history for other queries, your active role affects what else you can see in
Query History
:
If your active role is the ACCOUNTADMIN role, you can view all query history for the account.
If your active role has the MONITOR or OPERATE privilege granted on a warehouse, you can view queries run by other users that
use that warehouse.
If your active role is granted the GOVERNANCE_VIEWER database role for the SNOWFLAKE database, you can view the query history for all
users in your account. See
SNOWFLAKE database roles
.
If your active role is granted the READER_USAGE_VIEWER database role for the SNOWFLAKE database, you can view the query history for all
users in reader accounts associated with your account. See
SNOWFLAKE database roles
.
Considerations for using Query History
¶
When reviewing the
Query History
for your account, consider the following:
Details for queries executed more than 7 days ago do not include
User
information due to the data retention policy for
sessions
. You can use the user filter to retrieve queries run by individual users.
See
Filter Query History
.
For queries that failed due to syntax or parsing errors, you see
<redacted>
instead of the SQL statement that was executed.
If you are granted a role with appropriate privileges, you can set the
ENABLE_UNREDACTED_QUERY_SYNTAX_ERROR
parameter to view
the full query text.
Filters and the
Started
and
End Time
columns use your current time zone. You can’t change this setting.
Setting the
TIMEZONE
parameter for the session doesn’t change the time zone used.

Note
You might see incomplete or no results when you use the Query History page. Use filters to help ensure reliable results.

Monitor query activity with Query History
¶
To monitor query activity in your account, you can use:
The
Query History
page in Snowsight.
The
QUERY_HISTORY View
in the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema of the SNOWFLAKE database.
The
QUERY_HISTORY
family of table functions in
INFORMATION_SCHEMA
.
With the
Query History
page in Snowsight, you can do the following:
Monitor queries executed by users in your account.
View details about queries, including performance data. In some cases,
query details are unavailable
.
Explore each step of an executed query in the query profile.
The Query History page lets you explore queries executed in your Snowflake account over the last 14 days.
Within a worksheet, you can see the query history for queries that have been run in that worksheet.
See
View query history
.
Review Query History by using Snowsight
¶
To access the
Query History
page in Snowsight, do the following:
Sign in to Snowsight.
Select
Monitoring
»
Query History
.
Filter your view
to see the most relevant and accurate results.
Note
You might see incomplete or no results when you use the
Query History
page.

Documentation Title:

Documentation Content:
When the query started, in the user’s local timezone.
When the query ended, in the user’s local timezone.
The size of the warehouse used to run the query.
The duration of the query.
The query ID.
The query tag for the query, if one exists.
The driver status. For more details, see
Viewing Snowflake Client Versions
.
The name and version of the client, driver, or library used to submit the query.
For example,
Go
1.1.5
for queries run using Snowsight.
The session ID.
You can see the warehouse used to run the query and the user who ran the query listed above the
Query Details
tab.
Review the
SQL Text
section for the actual text of the query. You can hover over the SQL text to open the statement in a worksheet
or copy the statement. If the query failed, you can review the error details.
The
Results
section displays the results of the query. You can only view the first 10,000 rows of results, and
only the user who ran the query can view the results. Select
Export Results
to export the full set of results as a CSV-formatted file.
Troubleshoot why query details might be unavailable
¶
If a query doesn’t have query details, some possible causes include the following:
The query is still running. When the query finishes running, you can view the query details and profile.
Your role does not have privileges to view the query details.
The query was run more than 14 days ago and query details and profile are no longer available.
The query failed to run and therefore has no query profile.
Review Query Profile
¶
The
Query Profile
tab lets you explore the query execution plan and understand granular details about each step of execution.
The query profile is a powerful tool for understanding the mechanics of queries. It can be used whenever you need to know more about the
performance or behavior of a particular query. It is designed to help you spot typical mistakes in SQL query expressions to identify
potential performance bottlenecks and improvement opportunities.
This section provides a brief overview of how to navigate and use the query profile.
