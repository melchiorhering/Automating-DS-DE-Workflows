Example: Read Files from a Stage with Python Worksheets
¶
Snowpark Python lets you read files from a stage and write the contents to a table or save them as a view in Snowflake.
In this example, the Python code reads the contents of a compressed CSV-formatted file containing employee data,
data_0_0_0.csv.gz
from the
db1.public.files
named stage and writes the contents to a table called
employees
.
Note
To run this code example, you must use a role that has:
The USAGE privilege on the stage, database, and schema used in the code.
The CREATE TABLE privilege on the database schema to which you want to add the table.

Select a database and schema that you want to add the table to.
Select a warehouse to use to run the worksheet. If you have a default warehouse for your user, it is pre-selected.
Make sure your warehouse is running.
Write the Snowpark Python code as part of the
main
function:
import
snowflake.snowpark
as
snowpark
from
snowflake.snowpark.types
import

schema_for_file

"employees"

Write Snowpark code in Python worksheets —–
General Availability
¶
With this release, we are pleased to announce the general availability of Python worksheets in Snowsight. Python worksheets let
you write and run Snowpark Python code in a worksheet in Snowsight. You can now use Python version 3.11 or another
supported version.
In a Python worksheet, you can do the following:
Write a Python script to read data from a stage, transform it, and save it to a table, all without leaving Snowsight.
Use included packages from Anaconda or import packages from a stage to write code more easily.
Automate your Python code by deploying it as a stored procedure and scheduling it as a task.
For more information, see
Writing Snowpark Code in Python Worksheets
.
Recover worksheets for dropped users —–
General Availability
¶
With this release, we are pleased to announce the general availability of recovering Snowsight worksheets for users that have
been dropped from Snowflake. You can recover up to 500 worksheets for each dropped user.
For more details, see
Recover worksheets owned by a dropped user
.

Documentation Title:
Load and query sample data using Snowpark Python | Snowflake Documentation

Documentation Content:
The sample worksheet is not available
for other types of accounts.
Step 1. Sign in using Snowsight
¶
To access Snowsight over the public Internet, do the following:
In a supported web browser, navigate to
https://app.snowflake.com
.
Provide your
account identifier
or account URL.
If you’ve previously signed in to Snowsight, you might see an account name that you can select.
Sign in using your Snowflake account credentials.
Step 2. Open the Python worksheet
¶
You can use Python worksheets to write and run Python code. Your trial account has access
to a pre-loaded Python worksheet for this tutorial. The worksheet has the Python code that
you will run to create a database, load data into it, and query the data. For more information
about Python worksheets, see
Writing Snowpark Code in Python Worksheets
.
To open the pre-loaded tutorial Python worksheet:
Select
Projects
»
Worksheets
to open the list of worksheets.
Open
[Tutorial] Using Python to load and query sample data
.
Your worksheet looks similar to the following image.
This pre-loaded Python worksheet automatically uses the ACCOUNTADMIN system role so that
you can view and manage objects in your account. For more information, see
Using the ACCOUNTADMIN Role
.
The worksheet also uses the COMPUTE_WH virtual warehouse. A warehouse provides
the required resources to create and manage objects and run SQL commands. These
resources include CPU, memory, and temporary storage. For more information, see
Virtual warehouses
.
Step 3. Learn how to use Python worksheets
¶
Python worksheets let you use
Snowpark Python
in Snowsight to run SQL statements. This step in this tutorial describes the code in each step
in the Python worksheet. When you use a Python worksheet, you cannot run individual blocks of
code separately. You must run the whole worksheet. Before you select
Run
in the worksheet,
review the following steps so that you better understand the Python code.
