Nicely done.</p><p>In this tutorial, you got an end-to-end view of how you can emit and store log and trace data from handler code, then query the stored data.
Along the way, you:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Created an event table.</strong>For information related to event tables, refer to the following:</p><ul><p>For more detail on setting up an event table, refer to <span>Setting up an Event Table</span>.</p><p>For reference information about the columns that make up an event table, refer to
<span>Event table columns</span>.</p><p>For more on things you can do with event tables, refer to <span>Working with Event Tables</span>.</p></ul></li><li><p><strong>Created a user-defined function (UDF)</strong>that emitted log and trace data. For related information, refer to the following:</p><ul><p>For an overview of logging support in Snowflake, refer to <span>Logging Messages from Functions and Procedures</span>. For specific about
logging with Python, refer to <span>Logging Messages from Functions and Procedures</span>and the
<a>logging</a>module in Python’s standard library.</p><p>For details on setting the log level, refer to <span>Setting log level</span>.</p><p>For an overview of tracing support, refer to <span>Trace Events for Functions and Procedures</span>. For specific about tracing with Python,
refer to <span>Emitting trace events in Python</span>.</p><p>For details on setting the trace level, refer to <span>Setting trace level</span>.</p><p>For general information on creating UDFs, refer to <span>User-Defined Functions Overview</span>.</p></ul></li><li><p><strong>Queried the event table</strong>for log and trace data.

In the next section, you’ll start emitting log messages that Snowflake stores in the table.</p></section><section><h2>Emit Log Messages<a>¶</a></h2><p>In this section, you’ll create a user-defined function (UDF) with Python handler code that emits log messages. As your code emits log
messages, Snowflake collects the message data and stores it in the event table you created.</p><p>Snowflake supports APIs to log messages from each supported handler language. For handlers you write in Python, you can use the
<span>logging</span>module in Python’s standard library.</p><p>To create a UDF that emits log messages:</p><ol><li><p>Paste and run the following statement to set the log level to <span>INFO</span>.</p><div><pre><span>ALTER</span><span>SESSION</span><span>SET</span><span>LOG_LEVEL</span><span>=</span><span>INFO</span><span>;</span></pre><span>Copy</span></div><p>This specifies the severity of log messages that Snowflake should capture as the UDF runs.

Before tracing, use this setting to make
sure you’re capturing the log message severity.

In the next section, you’ll create an event table for storing
log and trace data.</p></section><section><h2>Create an Event Table<a>¶</a></h2><p>In this section, you’ll create an event table. As your handler code emits log messages and trace data, Snowflake saves the emitted data in
event table rows. You can query the event table to analyze the data.</p><p>You must create an event table to collect log and trace data. An event table always uses the
<span>predefined structure</span>defined by Snowflake.</p><div><p>Important</p><p>To complete this section, you’ll need to be able to use the ACCOUNTADMIN role, which is required when altering an account so that the new event
table is the account’s active event table.</p></div><p>To create the event table and make it the active event table for the account:</p><ol><li><p>Paste and run the following statement to create an event table.</p><div><div><pre><span>CREATE</span><span>OR</span><span>REPLACE</span><span>EVENT TABLE</span><span>tutorial_event_table</span><span>;</span></pre><span>Copy</span></div><p>This table is where Snowflake stores log and trace data.</p></div></li><li><p>Paste and run the following statement to alter the account so that the event table you created is the active one for the account.</p><div><pre><span>ALTER</span><span>ACCOUNT</span><span>SET</span><span>EVENT_TABLE</span><span>=</span><span>tutorial_log_trace_db</span><span>.</span><span>public</span><span>.</span><span>tutorial_event_table</span><span>;</span></pre><span>Copy</span></div><p>This statement sets the new event table as the table that Snowflake should use for storing log messages and trace data from handlers
in the current account. You can have only one active event table for an account.</p></li></ol><p>In this section, you created an event table.
