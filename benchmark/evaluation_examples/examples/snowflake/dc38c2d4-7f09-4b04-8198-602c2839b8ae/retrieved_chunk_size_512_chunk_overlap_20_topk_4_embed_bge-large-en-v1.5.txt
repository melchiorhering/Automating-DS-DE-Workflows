Querying data using worksheets | Snowflake Documentation

Documentation Content:
When you create a worksheet inside a folder, the worksheet is created with the role of your current session.
Note
To run a worksheet in a folder that was shared with you, even if you have
View and Run
or
Edit
permissions on the folder,
you must use the same role as the worksheet. If you do not have the same role, duplicate the worksheet and run it as one of your own roles.
Exploring the worksheet results
¶
Note
Available to most accounts. Accounts in U.S. government regions, accounts using Virtual Private Snowflake (VPS), and accounts
that use Private Connectivity to access Snowflake continue to see query results limited to 10,000 rows.
When you run one query or all queries in a worksheet, you see the query results.
The query results display as a table. You can navigate the query results with the arrow keys on your keyboard, as you would with a
spreadsheet. You can select columns, cells, rows, or ranges in the results table. You can copy and paste any selection.
For up to 1 million rows of results, you can review generated statistics that display contextual information for any selection,
as well as overall statistics. See
Automatic contextual statistics
for more details.
If you want to view your results as a chart, select
Chart
. For more details about charts, see
Visualizing worksheet data
.
Query results are cached. For more details, see
Stored results for past worksheet versions
and
Managing worksheet history and versions
.
Cost considerations for transforming query results
¶
Note
Available to most accounts. Accounts in U.S. government regions, accounts using Virtual Private Snowflake (VPS), and accounts
that use Private Connectivity to access Snowflake are not charged when transforming query results.
Note that some column transformation activities performed on the query results of Snowsight worksheets incur
compute cost. The compute cost is billed against the same warehouse used to run the query.
For example, when you sort a column by ascending or descending order using the column options, the changes affect all of your results,
instead of just the first 10,000 rows returned, and you incur compute cost.

Documentation Content:
The fully qualified object name appears after your cursor location in the worksheet.
For database tables and views, you can also add the column names to the worksheet that you’re editing:
Sign in to Snowsight.
Select
Projects

Databases
explorer.
Hover over the object name and select
…
more menu »

Format your queries
¶
When a worksheet is open, you can select the name of the worksheet to format the queries in your worksheet, and view the keyboard shortcuts.
Sign in to Snowsight.
Select
Projects
»

to open the list of worksheets.
Open a worksheet.
Hover over the tab for the worksheet and select
.
In the drop-down list, select

to format the query text for readability.
Load data to a table
¶
If you’re using a worksheet and want to add some data to work with, you can load data into a table without leaving your worksheet:
Sign in to Snowsight.
In the navigation menu, select
Projects
»
Worksheets
Open a worksheet.
Select
Objects
to view the object explorer.
Locate a specific table using search or browsing.
Hover over a specific table name and select
»
Load Data
.
Follow the prompts to upload one or more structured or unstructured files of 50MB or less.
Refer to
Loading data using the web interface
for more details.
Executing and running queries
¶
You can run a single query or multiple queries sequentially in the same worksheet.
To run a single query, in the query editor link, place your cursor in the query, and then select the
Run
button.
To run the entire worksheet, from the
More options
dropdown menu next to the
Run
button, select
Run All
.
Running worksheets in folders
¶
Folders no longer have a role assigned to them. An owner or editor of a worksheet in a folder can change the worksheet to run as any role.
You can also add
USE ROLE
to a worksheet in a folder to run different statements in the worksheet as different roles.

Load and query sample data using SQL | Snowflake Documentation

Documentation Content:
Provide your
account identifier
or account URL.
If you’ve previously signed in to Snowsight, you might see an account name that you can select.
Sign in using your Snowflake account credentials.
Step 2. Open the SQL worksheet for loading and querying data
¶
You can use worksheets to write and run SQL commands on your Snowflake database. Your trial account has access
to a pre-loaded worksheet for this tutorial. The worksheet has the SQL commands that
you will run to create a database, load data into it, and query the data. For more information
about worksheets, see
Getting started with worksheets
.
To open the pre-loaded tutorial worksheet:
Select
Projects
»
Worksheets
to open the list of worksheets.
Open
[Tutorial] Using SQL to load and query sample data
.
Your worksheet looks similar to the following image.
Step 3. Set the role and warehouse to use
¶
The role you use determines the privileges you have. In this tutorial, use the
ACCOUNTADMIN system role so that you can view and manage objects in your account.
For more information, see
Using the ACCOUNTADMIN Role
.
A warehouse provides the required resources to create and manage objects and run
SQL commands. These resources include CPU, memory, and temporary storage. Your
trial account has a virtual warehouse (
compute_wh
) that you can use for this
tutorial. For more information, see
Virtual warehouses
.
To set the role and warehouse to use, do the following:
In the open worksheet, place your cursor in the USE ROLE line.
USE
ROLE
accountadmin
;
Copy
In the upper-right corner of the worksheet, select
Run
.
Note
In this tutorial, run SQL statements one at a time. Do not select
Run All
.
Place your cursor in the USE WAREHOUSE line, then select
Run
.
USE
WAREHOUSE
compute_wh
;
Copy
Step 4. Create a database, schema, and table
¶
A database stores data in tables that you can manage and query. A schema is a logical
grouping of database objects, such as tables and views. For example, a schema might
contain the database objects required for a specific application.
