.
In the
User Name
field, enter a unique identifier for the user.
Note
User name is the unique identifier for the user in Snowflake. It is
not
the user’s login name (i.e. the name the user enters when logging into Snowflake). Snowflake allows users to have different user names and login names, if desired. You specify a login name for the user on the next screen.
In the
Password
and
Confirm Password
fields, enter the password for the user.
Leave the
Force Password Change
checkbox selected to force the user to change their password on their next login; otherwise, clear the checkbox.
Select
Next
. The
Advanced
screen opens.
Optionally enter the
Login Name
,
Display Name
, and personal information for the user.
Note
Users require a login name to log into Snowflake; if you don’t explicitly provide a login name, Snowflake uses their user name as the login name.
Select
Next
. The
Preferences
screen opens.
Optionally enter defaults for the user:
Virtual warehouse
Namespace in the form of
db_name
or
db_name
.
schema_name
Role
Select
Finish
. Snowflake displays a success message.
Using SQL
¶
Use the
CREATE USER
command to create a user.
Important
When creating a user, if you assign a default role to the user, you must then explicitly grant this role to the user.

Introduction
¶
This tutorial shows you how to create a user and grant a role to it by using SQL commands.
You use a template worksheet in Snowsight to follow and complete these tasks.
Note
Snowflake bills a minimal amount for the on-disk storage used for the sample data in
this tutorial. The tutorial provides steps to drop the database and minimize storage
cost.
Snowflake requires a
virtual warehouse
to load the
data and execute queries. A running virtual warehouse consumes Snowflake credits.
In this tutorial, you will be using a
30-day trial account
,
which provides free credits, so you won’t incur any costs.
What you will learn
¶
In this tutorial you will learn how to:
Use a role that has the privileges to create and use the Snowflake objects required by this tutorial.
Create a user.
Grant a role to the user and grant access to a warehouse.
Explore the users and roles in your account.
Drop the user you created.
Prerequisites
¶
This tutorial assumes the following:
You have a
supported browser
.
You have a trial account. If you do not have a trial account yet, you can sign up
for a
free trial
. You can choose any
Snowflake Cloud Region
.
Your user is the account administrator and is granted the ACCOUNTADMIN system role. For more information, see
Using the ACCOUNTADMIN Role
.
Note
This tutorial is only available to users with a trial account. The sample worksheet is not available
for other types of accounts.
Step 1. Sign in using Snowsight
¶
To access Snowsight over the public Internet, do the following:
In a supported web browser, navigate to
https://app.snowflake.com
.
Provide your
account identifier
or account URL.
If you’ve previously signed in to Snowsight, you might see an account name that you can select.
Sign in using your Snowflake account credentials.
Step 2.
