Summary and key points
¶
In summary, you used a pre-loaded template worksheet in Snowsight to complete the following steps:
Set the role and warehouse to use.
Create a database, schema, and table.
Create a storage integration and configure permissions on cloud storage.
Create a stage and load the data from the stage into the table.
Query the data.
Here are some key points to remember about loading and querying data:
You need the required permissions to create and manage objects in your account. In this tutorial,
you use the ACCOUNTADMIN system role for these privileges.
This role is not normally used to create objects. Instead, we recommend creating a hierarchy of
roles aligned with business functions in your organization. For more information, see
Using the ACCOUNTADMIN Role
.
You need a warehouse for the resources required to create and manage objects and run SQL commands.
This tutorial uses the
compute_wh
warehouse included with your trial account.
You created a database to store the data and a schema to group the database objects logically.
You created a storage integration and a stage to load data from a CSV file stored in an AWS S3 bucket.
After the data was loaded into your database, you queried it using a SELECT statement.

Documentation Title:
Bulk loading from Amazon S3 | Snowflake Documentation

Documentation Content:
As illustrated in the diagram below, loading data from an S3 bucket is performed in two steps:
Step 1
:
Snowflake assumes the data files have already been staged in an S3 bucket. If they haven’t been staged yet, use the upload interfaces/utilities provided by AWS to stage the files.
Step 2
:
Use the
COPY INTO <table>
command to load the contents of the staged file(s) into a Snowflake database table. You can load directly from the bucket, but
Snowflake recommends creating an external stage that references the bucket and using the external stage instead.
Regardless of the method you use, this step requires a running, current virtual warehouse for the session if you execute the command
manually or within a script. The warehouse provides the compute resources to perform the actual insertion of rows into the table.
Note
Snowflake uses Amazon S3 Gateway Endpoints in each of its Amazon Virtual Private Clouds.
If the S3 bucket referenced by your external stage is in the same region as your Snowflake account, your network traffic does not traverse the public Internet. The Amazon S3 Gateway Endpoints ensure that regional traffic stays within the AWS network.
Tip
The instructions in this set of topics assume you have read
Preparing to load data
and have created a named file format, if desired.
Before you begin, you may also want to read

In Row 1, a hyphen was mistakenly replaced with the pipe (

In Row 5, an additional pipe (

Fix the errors and load the data files again
¶
In regular use, you would fix the problematic records manually and write them to a new data file.
You would then stage the fixed data files to the S3 bucket and attempt to reload the data from
the files. For this tutorial, you are using Snowflake provided sample data, which you do not correct.
Verify the loaded data
¶
Execute a
SELECT
statement to verify that the data was loaded successfully.

Introduction
¶
This tutorial describes how to load data from files in an existing Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket into a table. In this tutorial, you will learn how to:
Create named file formats that describe your data files.
Create named stage objects.
Load data located in your S3 bucket into Snowflake tables.
Resolve errors in your data files.
The tutorial covers loading of both CSV and JSON data.
Prerequisites
¶
The tutorial assumes the following:
You have a Snowflake account that is configured to use Amazon Web Services (AWS) and a user with a role that grants the necessary
privileges to create a database, tables, and virtual warehouse objects.
You have SnowSQL installed.
Refer to the
Snowflake in 20 minutes
for instructions to meet these requirements.
Snowflake provides sample data files in a public Amazon S3 bucket for use in this tutorial.
But before you start, you need to create a database, tables, and a virtual warehouse for
this tutorial. These are the basic Snowflake objects needed for most Snowflake activities.
About the sample data files
¶
Snowflake provides sample data files staged in a public S3 bucket.
Note
In regular use, you would stage your own data files using the AWS Management Console, AWS Command
Line Interface, or an equivalent client application. See the
Amazon Web Services
documentation for instructions.
The sample data files include sample contact information in the following formats:
CSV files that contain a header row and five records. The field delimiter is the pipe (
|
) character.
The following example shows a header row and one record:
ID
|
lastname
|
firstname
|
company
|
email
|
workphone
|
cellphone
|
streetaddress
|
city
|
postalcode
