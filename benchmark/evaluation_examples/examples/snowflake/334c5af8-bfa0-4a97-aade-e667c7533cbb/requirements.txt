# Detailed requirements:

1. Sort the result according to people votes. I expect movies with higher votes come first
2. Add headers. But replace all special symbols into whitespaces and first characters into upper cases.
For example, "from_city" is changed to "From City"
3. For the special field `votes`, replace the original text values into numbers
5. For other fields, if the output result is empty or null, use `NA` instead in the output
6. Preserve the default order of all columns
