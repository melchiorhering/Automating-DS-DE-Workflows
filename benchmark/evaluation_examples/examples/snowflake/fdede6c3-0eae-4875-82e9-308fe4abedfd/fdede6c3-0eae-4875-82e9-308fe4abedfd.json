    "instruction": "I intend to find some specific customers in the database. Please create a new SQL worksheet named \"Top 10 customers from China with the most account balances\". Select the \"SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA\" database and the \"TPCH_SF1\" schema for the worksheet. Finally, you need to write a SQL to retrieve the information of those customers. Note that you do not need to run the SQL. Also, do not close the webpage because I'll use it later.\nHere is a step-by-step tutorial from an expert instructing you how to complete it:\nTo find the specific customers in the database, please follow these steps:\n1. Click the \"+\" button on the top right;\n2. Choose \"SQL Worksheet\" in the drop-down panel;\n3. Click the icon \"â‹®\" on the worksheet tab on the top left;\n4. Choose \"Rename\" in the drop-down panel;\n5. Type \"Top 10 customers from China with the most account balances\" in the input box and press Enter;\n6. Click the database and schema selector (initially shown as \"No Database selected\");\n7. Choose \"SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA\" in the drop-down panel;\n8. Choose \"TPCH_SF1\" in the expanded panel;\n9. In the blank worksheet, type in command:\n`SELECT C.* FROM CUSTOMER AS C JOIN NATION AS N ON C.C_NATIONKEY = N.N_NATIONKEY WHERE N.N_NAME = 'CHINA' ORDER BY C.C_ACCTBAL DESC LIMIT 10`\nYou can exactly follow the detailed plan above or proactively tackle the task based on the real-time environment interaction by yourself.",
