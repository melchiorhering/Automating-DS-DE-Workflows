## Tool Categories

### Hugging Face Tools (`/hf`)

The `hf` directory contains tools built for integration with Hugging Face's ecosystem, specifically designed for use with SmolAgents. These tools enable AI agents to leverage Hugging Face's models and capabilities for various tasks.

SmolAgents are lightweight AI agents that can be deployed in resource-constrained environments while still providing powerful functionality.

### MCP Tools (`/mcp`)

The `mcp` directory contains tools built using Anthropic's MCP (Machine Cognition Protocol) framework. These tools are designed to enhance AI agents with structured reasoning capabilities following Anthropic's specifications.

MCP enables AI systems to break down complex tasks into manageable steps through structured protocols, improving reliability and reasoning.

## Getting Started

Each directory contains specific documentation for the tools within that category. Please refer to the README files within each directory for detailed information on installation, usage, and contribution guidelines.
