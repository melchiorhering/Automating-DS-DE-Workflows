Exploring Data in Superset | Superset

Documentation Content:
The following section
explains how to enable this functionality for the examples database.</p><p>In the top menu, select <strong>Data ‣ Databases</strong>. Find the <strong>examples</strong>database in the list and
select the <strong>Edit</strong>button.</p><p>In the resulting modal window, switch to the <strong>Extra</strong>tab and
tick the checkbox for <strong>Allow Data Upload</strong>. End by clicking the <strong>Save</strong>button.</p><h3>Loading CSV Data<a>​</a></h3><p>Download the CSV dataset to your computer from
<a>GitHub</a>.
In the Superset menu, select <strong>Data ‣ Upload a CSV</strong>.</p><p>Then, enter the <strong>Table Name</strong>as <em>tutorial_flights</em>and select the CSV file from your computer.</p><p>Next enter the text <em>Travel Date</em>into the <strong>Parse Dates</strong>field.</p><p>Leaving all the other options in their default settings, select <strong>Save</strong>at the bottom of the page.</p><h3>Table Visualization<a>​</a></h3><p>You should now see <em>tutorial_flights</em>as a dataset in the <strong>Datasets</strong>tab. Click on the entry to
launch an Explore workflow using this dataset.</p><p>In this section, we'll create a table visualization
to show the number of flights and cost per travel class.</p><p>By default, Apache Superset only shows the last week of data. In our example, we want to visualize all
of the data in the dataset. Click the <strong>Time ‣ Time Range</strong>section and change
the <strong>Range Type</strong>to <strong>No Filter</strong>.</p><p>Click <strong>Apply</strong>to save.</p><p>Now, we want to specify the rows in our table by using the <strong>Group by</strong>option.

FAQ | Superset

Documentation Content:
Read the instructions <a>here</a>to learn
how to enable and use CSV upload.</p><h2>Why are my queries timing out?<a>​</a></h2><p>There are many possible causes for why a long-running query might time out.</p><p>For running long query from Sql Lab, by default Superset allows it run as long as 6 hours before it
being killed by celery. If you want to increase the time for running query, you can specify the
timeout in configuration. For example:</p><span>SQLLAB_ASYNC_TIME_LIMIT_SEC = 60 * 60 * 6</span><p>If you are seeing timeouts (504 Gateway Time-out) when loading dashboard or explore slice, you are
probably behind gateway or proxy server (such as Nginx). If it did not receive a timely response
from Superset server (which is processing long queries), these web servers will send 504 status code
to clients directly. Superset has a client-side timeout limit to address this issue. If query didn’t
come back within client-side timeout (60 seconds by default), Superset will display warning message
to avoid gateway timeout message. If you have a longer gateway timeout limit, you can change the
timeout settings in <strong>superset_config.py</strong>:</p><span>SUPERSET_WEBSERVER_TIMEOUT = 60</span><h2>Why is the map not visible in the geospatial visualization?<a>​</a></h2><p>You need to register a free account at <a>Mapbox.com</a>, obtain an API key, and add it
to <strong>.env</strong>at the key MAPBOX_API_KEY:</p><span>MAPBOX_API_KEY = "longstringofalphanumer1c"</span><h2>How to limit the timed refresh on a dashboard?<a>​</a></h2><p>By default, the dashboard timed refresh feature allows you to automatically re-query every slice on
a dashboard according to a set schedule. Sometimes, however, you won’t want all of the slices to be
refreshed - especially if some data is slow moving, or run heavy queries.

].schema].table name"</span><span>;</span></span><p>For example:</p><span><span>SELECT</span><span>*</span><span>FROM</span><span>"examples.birth_names"</span><span>;</span></span><p>Spaces are allowed, but periods in the names must be replaced by <code>%2E</code>. Eg:</p><span><span>SELECT</span><span>*</span><span>FROM</span><span>"Superset meta database.examples%2Ebirth_names"</span><span>;</span></span><p>The query above returns the same rows as <code>SELECT * FROM "examples.birth_names"</code>, and also shows that the meta database can query tables from any table — even itself!</p><h4>Considerations<a>​</a></h4><p>Before enabling this feature, there are a few considerations that you should have in mind. First, the meta database enforces permissions on the queried tables, so users should only have access via the database to tables that they originally have access to. Nevertheless, the meta database is a new surface for potential attacks, and bugs could allow users to see data they should not.</p><p>Second, there are performance considerations. The meta database will push any filtering, sorting, and limiting to the underlying databases, but any aggregations and joins will happen in memory in the process running the query. Because of this, it's recommended to run the database in async mode, so queries are executed in Celery workers, instead of the web workers. Additionally, it's possible to specify a hard limit on how many rows are returned from the underlying databases.</p><h4>Enabling the meta database<a>​</a></h4><p>To enable the Superset meta database, first you need to set the <code>ENABLE_SUPERSET_META_DB</code>feature flag to true. Then, add a new database of type "Superset meta database" with the SQLAlchemy URI "superset://".</p><p>If you enable DML in the meta database users will be able to run DML queries on underlying databases <strong>as long as DML is also enabled in them</strong>.

If the connection looks good, save the configuration
by clicking the <strong>Connect</strong>button in the bottom right corner of the modal window:</p><p>Congratulations, you've just added a new data source in Superset!</p><h3>Registering a new table<a>​</a></h3><p>Now that you’ve configured a data source, you can select specific tables (called <strong>Datasets</strong>in Superset)
that you want exposed in Superset for querying.</p><p>Navigate to <strong>Data ‣ Datasets</strong>and select the <strong>+ Dataset</strong>button in the top right corner.</p><p>A modal window should pop up in front of you. Select your <strong>Database</strong>,
<strong>Schema</strong>, and <strong>Table</strong>using the drop downs that appear. In the following example,
we register the <strong>cleaned_sales_data</strong>table from the <strong>examples</strong>database.</p><p>To finish, click the <strong>Add</strong>button in the bottom right corner. You should now see your dataset in the list of datasets.</p><h3>Customizing column properties<a>​</a></h3><p>Now that you've registered your dataset, you can configure column properties
for how the column should be treated in the Explore workflow:</p><ul><li>Is the column temporal? (should it be used for slicing &amp; dicing in time series charts?)</li><li>Should the column be filterable?</li><li>Is the column dimensional?</li><li>If it's a datetime column, how should Superset parse
the datetime format? (using the <a>ISO-8601 string pattern</a>)</li></ul><h3>Superset semantic layer<a>​</a></h3><p>Superset has a thin semantic layer that adds many quality of life improvements for analysts.
The Superset semantic layer can store 2 types of computed data:</p><li>Virtual metrics: you can write SQL queries that aggregate values
from multiple column (e.g.
