Publish this chart
to your existing Tutorial Dashboard you created earlier.</p><h3>Line Chart<a>​</a></h3><p>In this section, we are going to create a line chart to understand the average price of a ticket by
month across the entire dataset.</p><p>In the Time section, as before, keep the Time Column as Travel Date and Time Grain as month but this
time for the Time range select No filter as we want to look at entire dataset.</p><p>Within Metrics, remove the default <code>COUNT(*)</code>metric and instead add <code>AVG(Cost)</code>, to show the mean value.</p><p>Next, select <strong>Run Query</strong>to show the data on the chart.</p><p>How does this look? Well, we can see that the average cost goes up in December. However, perhaps it
doesn’t make sense to combine both single and return tickets, but rather show two separate lines for
each ticket type.</p><p>Let’s do this by selecting Ticket Single or Return in the Group by box, and the selecting <strong>Run
Query</strong>again. Nice! We can see that on average single tickets are cheaper than returns and that the
big spike in December is caused by return tickets.</p><p>Our chart is looking pretty good already, but let’s customize some more by going to the Customize
tab on the left hand pane. Within this pane, try changing the Color Scheme, removing the range
filter by selecting No in the Show Range Filter drop down and adding some labels using X Axis Label
and Y Axis Label.</p><p>Once you’re done, publish the chart in your Tutorial Dashboard.</p><h3>Markup<a>​</a></h3><p>In this section, we will add some text to our dashboard. If you’re there already, you can navigate
to the dashboard by selecting Dashboards on the top menu, then Tutorial dashboard from the list of
dashboards. Got into edit mode by selecting <strong>Edit dashboard</strong>.</p><p>Within the Insert components pane, drag and drop a Markdown box on the dashboard.

To start the Explore workflow from the <strong>Datasets</strong>tab, start by clicking the name
of the dataset that will be powering your chart.</p><p>You're now presented with a powerful workflow for exploring data and iterating on charts.</p><ul><li>The <strong>Dataset</strong>view on the left-hand side has a list of columns and metrics,
scoped to the current dataset you selected.</li><li>The <strong>Data</strong>preview below the chart area also gives you helpful data context.</li><li>Using the <strong>Data</strong>tab and <strong>Customize</strong>tabs, you can change the visualization type,
select the temporal column, select the metric to group by, and customize
the aesthetics of the chart.</li></ul><p>As you customize your chart using drop-down menus, make sure to click the <strong>Run</strong>button
to get visual feedback.</p><p>In the following screenshot, we craft a grouped Time-series Bar Chart to visualize
our quarterly sales data by product line just by clicking options in drop-down menus.</p><h3>Creating a slice and dashboard<a>​</a></h3><p>To save your chart, first click the <strong>Save</strong>button. You can either:</p><ul><li>Save your chart and add it to an existing dashboard</li><li>Save your chart and add it to a new dashboard</li></ul><p>In the following screenshot, we save the chart to a new "Superset Duper Sales Dashboard":</p><p>To publish, click <strong>Save and goto Dashboard</strong>.</p><p>Behind the scenes, Superset will create a slice and store all the information needed
to create your chart in its thin data layer
(the query, chart type, options selected, name, etc).</p><p>To resize the chart, start by clicking the Edit Dashboard button in the top right corner.</p><p>Then, click and drag the bottom right corner of the chart until the chart layout snaps
into a position you like onto the underlying grid.</p><p>Click <strong>Save</strong>to persist the changes.</p><p>Congrats!

Select <strong>Run Query</strong>to show the
chart. You should see the total cost per day for each month in October 2011.</p><p>Finally, save the visualization as Tutorial Advanced Analytics Base, adding it to the Tutorial
Dashboard.</p><h3>Rolling Mean<a>​</a></h3><p>There is quite a lot of variation in the data, which makes it difficult to identify any trend. One
approach we can take is to show instead a rolling average of the time series. To do this, in the
<strong>Moving Average</strong>subsection of <strong>Advanced Analytics</strong>, select mean in the <strong>Rolling</strong>box and
enter 7 into both Periods and Min Periods. The period is the length of the rolling period expressed
as a multiple of the Time Grain. In our example, the Time Grain is day, so the rolling period is 7
days, such that on the 7th October 2011 the value shown would correspond to the first seven days of
October 2011. Lastly, by specifying Min Periods as 7, we ensure that our mean is always calculated
on 7 days and we avoid any ramp up period.</p><p>After displaying the chart by selecting <strong>Run Query</strong>you will see that the data is less variable
and that the series starts later as the ramp up period is excluded.</p><p>Save the chart as Tutorial Rolling Mean and add it to the Tutorial Dashboard.</p><h3>Time Comparison<a>​</a></h3><p>In this section, we will compare values in our time series to the value a week before. Start off by
opening the Tutorial Advanced Analytics Base chart, by going to <strong>Charts</strong>in the top menu and then
selecting the visualization name in the list (alternatively, find the chart in the Tutorial
Dashboard and select Explore chart from the menu for that visualization).</p><p>Next, in the Time Comparison subsection of <strong>Advanced Analytics</strong>, enter the Time Shift by typing in
“minus 1 week” (note this box accepts input in natural language).
