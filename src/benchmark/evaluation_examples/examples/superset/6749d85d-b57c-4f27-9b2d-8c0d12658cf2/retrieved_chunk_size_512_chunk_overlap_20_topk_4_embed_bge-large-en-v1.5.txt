Creating Your First Dashboard | Superset

Documentation Content:
Congrats! You’ve successfully linked, analyzed, and visualized data in Superset. There are a wealth
of other table configuration and visualization options, so please start exploring and creating
slices and dashboards of your own
ֿ
Manage access to Dashboards
​
Access to dashboards is managed via owners (users that have edit permissions to the dashboard)
Non-owner users access can be managed two different ways:
Dataset permissions - if you add to the relevant role permissions to datasets it automatically grants implicit access to all dashboards that uses those permitted datasets
Dashboard roles - if you enable
DASHBOARD_RBAC
feature flag
then you be able to manage which roles can access the dashboard
Granting a role access to a dashboard will bypass dataset level checks. Having dashboard access implicitly grants read access to all the featured charts in the dashboard, and thereby also all the associated datasets.
If no roles are specified for a dashboard, regular
Dataset permissions
will apply.
Customizing dashboard
​
The following URL parameters can be used to modify how the dashboard is rendered:
standalone
:
0
(default): dashboard is displayed normally
1
: Top Navigation is hidden
2
: Top Navigation + title is hidden
3
: Top Navigation + title + top level tabs are hidden
show_filters
:
0
: render dashboard without Filter Bar
1
(default): render dashboard with Filter Bar if native filters are enabled
expand_filters
:
(default): render dashboard with Filter Bar expanded if there are native filters
0
: render dashboard with Filter Bar collapsed
1
: render dashboard with Filter Bar expanded
For example, when running the local development build, the following will disable the
Top Nav and remove the Filter Bar:
http://localhost:8088/superset/dashboard/my-dashboard/?standalone=1&show_filters=0
