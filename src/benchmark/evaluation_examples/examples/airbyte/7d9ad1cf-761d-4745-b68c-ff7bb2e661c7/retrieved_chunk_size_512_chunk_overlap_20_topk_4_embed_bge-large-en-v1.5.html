Validate data replication pipelines from Postgres to Snowflake with data-diff | Airbyte

This will bring you to a screen where you can select your data source. Choose “<a>Postgres</a>” as your source type.</p><p>Now you will be brought to a screen where you need to enter some specific information about your Postgres database. This includes host, port, database name, and a list of the schemas you wish to sync. </p><p>I kept the default port and added my database named `development`, `customers` schema, and the login information for my Airbyte user. It is best practice to <a>create users specific to the tools</a>you are connecting to your database.</p><h3>Set up your Snowflake destination</h3><p>Now let’s set up our <a>Snowflake destination</a>where we will be replicating our Postgres data to. Start by clicking on “new destination” in the top right corner. Then select “Snowflake” as your destination type.</p><p>‍</p><p>This is where you will input the information for the Snowflake database that you are copying your Postgres data. Make sure you enter the right location information! </p><p>I also recommend setting up a role that is specific for loading data in your destination as well. This will help keep your environment secure and all you to closely monitor different metrics on the replication process.</p><h3>Set up a Postgres to Snowflake connection</h3><p>Now that you’ve created both your source in Postgres and your destination in Snowflake, you can set up a connection between the two to replicate your data from Postgres. Select “connections” on the left panel.</p><p>Select your Postgres source you created from the dropdown, then select Snowflake as your destination.</p><p>Now you’ll want to give the connection a good name and choose how often it replicates. I’m going to call mine “postgres_snowflake_replication” and set it t replicate every 24 hours. </p><p>I also recommend selecting “mirror source structure” for the “destination namespace”. This will allow you to easily compare the differences between the source table and the destination table.

It supports both Full Refresh and Incremental syncs. You can choose if this connector will copy only the new or updated data, or all rows in the tables and columns you set up for replication, every time a sync is run.</p><p>This Snowflake source connector is built on top of the source-jdbc code base and is configured to rely on JDBC 3.14.1 <a>Snowflake driver</a>as described in Snowflake <a>documentation</a>.</p><h4>Resulting schema<a>​</a></h4><p>The Snowflake source does not alter the schema present in your warehouse. Depending on the destination connected to this source, however, the result schema may be altered.

We will easily integrate data from Postgres databases with Airbyte using terraform airbyte provider. This template could be act as a starter for integrating and also adding new sources, etc... the limits are endless.</p><p>This quickstart is designed to minimize setup hassles and propel you forward.</p><h2>Infrastructure Layout</h2><h2>Prerequisites</h2><p>Before you embark on this integration, ensure you have the following set up and ready:</p><ol><li><strong>Python 3.10 or later</strong>: If not installed, download and install it from <a>Python's official website</a>.</li><li><strong>Docker and Docker Compose (Docker Desktop)</strong>: Install <a>Docker</a>following the official documentation for your specific OS.</li><li><strong>Airbyte OSS version</strong>: Deploy the open-source version of Airbyte. Follow the installation instructions from the <a>Airbyte Documentation</a>.</li><li><strong>Terraform</strong>: Terraform will help you provision and manage the Airbyte resources. If you haven't installed it, follow the <a>official Terraform installation guide</a>.</li></ol><h2>1. Setting an environment for your project</h2><p>Get the project up and running on your local machine by following these steps:</p><p><strong>1. Clone the repository (Clone only this quickstart)</strong>:</p><code>git clone --filter=blob:none --sparse  https://github.com/airbytehq/quickstarts.git</code><code>cd quickstarts</code><code>git sparse-checkout add postgres_snowflake_integration</code><p><strong>2. Navigate to the directory</strong>:</p><code>cd postgres_snowflake_integration</code><p><strong>3.
