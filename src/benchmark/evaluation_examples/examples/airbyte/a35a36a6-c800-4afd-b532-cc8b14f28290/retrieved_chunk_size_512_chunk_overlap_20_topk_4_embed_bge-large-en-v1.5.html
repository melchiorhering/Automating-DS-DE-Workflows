</code><p>If you have an existing Airbyte instance that you want to version control, you can get the configurations with the <strong>octavia import all</strong>command after you init an Octavia CLI project.</p><h2>Create a Postgres source with Octavia CLI</h2><p>Next, you will configure a <a>Postgres source</a>. To create a source definition with Octavia CLI you can use the <strong>octavia generate source </strong>command. You will need to pass a DEFINITION_ID and RESOURCE_NAME. Due to a <a>current limitation</a>, to create a source, you first need to get the definition id for the source. You can run the command <strong>octavia list connectors sources </strong>to get the connector id:</p><code>octavia list connectors sources | grep postgres

Postgres                                airbyte/source-postgres                        1.0.22            decd338e-5647-4c0b-adf4-da0e75f5a750
</code><p>Then you can bootstrap a Postgres source with the <strong>octavia generate source</strong>command:</p><code>octavia generate source decd338e-5647-4c0b-adf4-da0e75f5a750 postgres

🐙 - Octavia is targetting your Airbyte instance running at http://localhost:8000 on workspace 36ddb450-66e4-4988-91bf-67279eed5098.
✅ - Created the source template for postgres in sources/postgres/configuration.yaml.
</code><p>The CLI creates a <strong>postgres</strong>folder under sources with a <strong>configuration.yaml</strong>file.</p><code>tree .

😴 - Did not update because no change detected.
</code><p>Then you can see that the changes were applied in the UI. Remember to test the connection.</p><h2>Create a connection with Octavia CLI</h2><p>Once you have source and destination configuration files, you can create a connection template with the <strong>octavia generate connection</strong>command.</p><code>octavia generate connection --source sources/postgres/configuration.yaml --destination destinations/bigquery/configuration.yaml postgres-to-bigquery

🐙 - Octavia is targetting your Airbyte instance running at http://localhost:8000 on workspace 36ddb450-66e4-4988-91bf-67279eed5098.
✅ - Created the connection template for postgres-to-bigquery in connections/postgres_to_bigquery/configuration.yaml.
</code><p>After editing the configuration, your configuration should look like this:</p><code>cat connections/postgres_to_bigquery/configuration.yaml

resource_name: "postgres-to-bigquery"
source_configuration_path: sources/postgres/configuration.yaml

          supported_sync_modes:

</code><p>Notice that the stream configuration was generated automatically and, as stated in the comments, “ONLY edit streams.config, streams.stream should not be edited as schema cannot be changed".

Follow this <a>Postgres replication</a>tutorial to create a Postgres database locally with sample data.</li><li>A BigQuery instance or another destination you can use instead. Follow this <a>Postgres to BigQuery</a>tutorial to configure a BigQuery project.</li></ul><h2>Bootstrap an Octavia CLI project</h2><p>You can install Octavia CLI as a command available in your bash profile with Docker or modify your Airbyte docker-compose.yml file to apply the configuration on start. You can explore these three modes in the <a>Octavia CLI documentation</a>. Note that you should install the same Octavia version as the targetted Airbyte instance to avoid <a>API incompatibility issues</a>.</p><p>Here you can install the latest Octavia version as a bash command:</p><code>curl -s -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/airbytehq/airbyte/master/octavia-cli/install.sh | bash

octavia alias will be added to /home/ari/.bashrc
🐙 - 💾 The octavia env file was created at /home/ari/.octavia
❓ - Allow Airbyte to collect telemetry to improve the CLI? (Y/n)Y
🐙 - Pulling image for octavia 0.40.18
🐙 - 🎉 octavia 0.40.18 image was pulled
🐙 - 🎉 octavia alias was added to /home/ari/.bashrc!
🐙 - Please open a new terminal window or run source /home/ari/.bashrc
</code><p>The .octavia file is where you configure environment variables and secrets. The file content will be used to set the environment variables of the Octavia CLI container that runs when you call the octavia command.

Documentation Content:
You can set environment variables in your <strong>~/.octavia</strong>file. Then you can reference these variables on your configuration files with ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}. After editing the configuration, it should look like this:</p><code>cat sources/postgres/configuration.yaml

resource_name: "postgres"
definition_type: source
definition_id: decd338e-5647-4c0b-adf4-da0e75f5a750
definition_image: airbyte/source-postgres
definition_version: 1.0.14

configuration:
  host: ${POSTGRES_HOST}
  port: 2000
  schemas: ["public"]
  database: ${POSTGRES_DATABASE}
  password: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
  ssl_mode:
    mode: "disable"
  username: ${POSTGRES_USERNAME}
  tunnel_method:
    tunnel_method: "NO_TUNNEL"
  replication_method:
    method: "Standard"
</code><p>To apply the changes to your local Airbyte instance, you can run <strong>octavia apply</strong>. Octavia will validate the configuration against a JSON schema and will fail to apply the changes if finding any configuration error. If an error occurs, you will get a stack trace from the API response.</p><code>octavia apply

🐙 - Octavia is targetting your Airbyte instance running at http://localhost:8000 on workspace 36ddb450-66e4-4988-91bf-67279eed5098.
🐙 - postgres does not exists on your Airbyte instance, let's create it!
🎉 - Successfully created postgres on your Airbyte instance!
💾 - New state for postgres saved at ./sources/postgres/state_36ddb450-66e4-4988-91bf-67279eed5098.yaml
</code><p>Then you can check that the configuration is also available in the UI.</p><p>After you apply some configuration changes with Octavia, no connection test will be run like when you save connector settings in the UI (see <a>GitHub issue</a>).
