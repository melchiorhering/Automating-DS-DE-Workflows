How to Create an Airbyte Python Destination: DuckDB | Airbyte

:param logger: Logging object to display debug/info/error to the logs
            (logs will not be accessible via airbyte UI if they are not passed to this logger)
        :param config: Json object containing the configuration of this destination, content of this json is as specified in
        the properties of the spec.json file

        :return: AirbyteConnectionStatus indicating a Success or Failure</code><p>The way we can achieve that is by checking the input `config` parameters and setting up a connection to the database. If all parameters are ok and the connection establishes, we return the `Status.SUCCEEDED`.</p><strong>Function write()</strong><p>The write function reads the data passed from the source connector to our destination. You can see below in the function definition that we get a list of<a>Airbyte Messages</a>. This is important to know as Airbyte serialized data into JSON Messages, making it possible to convert any source to any destination.</p><p>We also get the<a>ConfiguredAirbyteCatalog</a>, which describes the schema of the messages and how it's persisted in the destination.</p><code>def write(
        self, config: Mapping[str, Any], configured_catalog: ConfiguredAirbyteCatalog, input_messages: Iterable[AirbyteMessage]
    ) -&gt; Iterable[AirbyteMessage]:

        """
        Reads the input stream of messages, config, and catalog to write data to the destination.

        This method returns an iterable (typically a generator of AirbyteMessages via yield) containing state messages received in the input message stream. Outputting a state message means that every AirbyteRecordMessage which came before it has been successfully persisted to the destination. This is used to ensure fault tolerance in the case that a sync fails before fully completing, then the source is given the last state message output from this method as the starting point of the next sync.

connection links a source to a destination and defines how your data will sync. After you have created a connection, you can modify any of the configuration settings or stream settings.</p><h2>Configure Connection Settings<a>​</a></h2><p>Configuring the connection settings allows you to manage various aspects of the sync, such as how often data syncs and where data is written.</p><p>To configure these settings:</p><ol><p>In the Airbyte UI, click <strong>Connections</strong>and then click the connection you want to change.</p><p>Click the <strong>Settings</strong>tab.</p><p>Click the <strong>Configuration</strong>dropdown to expand the options.</p></ol><div><div>note</div><p>These settings apply to all streams in the connection.</p></div><p>You can configure the following settings:</p><table><tr><th>Setting</th><th>Description</th></tr><tbody><tr><td>Connection Name</td><td>A custom name for your connection</td></tr><tr><a>Schedule Type</a><td>How often data syncs (can be scheduled, cron, API-triggered or manual)</td></tr><tr><a>Destination Namespace</a><td>Where the replicated data is written to in the destination</td></tr><tr><td>Destination Stream Prefix</td><td>A prefix added to each table name in the destination</td></tr><tr><a>Detect and propagate schema changes</a><td>How Airbyte handles schema changes in the source</td></tr><tr><a>Connection Data Residency</a><td>Where data will be processed (Cloud only)</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Modify Streams<a>​</a></h2><p>On the "Schema" tab, you choose which streams to sync and how they are loaded to the destination.</p><div><div>info</div><p>A connection's schema consists of one or many streams.
