<a>Google Cloud Public Dataset Program</a>.
A public dataset is any dataset that is stored in BigQuery and
made available to the general public. The
public datasets are datasets that BigQuery hosts for
you to access and integrate into your applications. Google pays for the storage
of these datasets and provides public access to the data via a
<a>project</a>. You pay only for the queries that
you perform on the data (the first 1 TB per month is free, subject to
<a>query pricing details</a>.)</p><h3>The NYC Citi Bike Trips dataset</h3><a>NYC Citi Bike Trips</a><p>Citi Bike is the nation's largest bike share program, with 10,000 bikes and 600
stations across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and Jersey City. This dataset
includes Citi Bike trips since Citi Bike launched in September 2013 and is
updated daily.
