Note
: If you don't plan to keep the
    resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
    selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
    delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Go to project selector
Optional: If you
    select an existing project, make sure that you
enable
      the BigQuery API
. The BigQuery API is automatically
      enabled in new projects.
Create a BigQuery dataset
Use the Google Cloud console to create a dataset that stores the data.
In the Google Cloud console, open the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
In the
Explorer
panel, click your project name.
Expand the
more_vert
View actions > Create dataset
.
On the
Create dataset
page, do the following:
For
Dataset ID
, enter
babynames
.
From the
Data location
list, choose
us (multiple regions in United States)
.
     The public datasets are stored in the
us
multi-region
location
. For simplicity,
      store your
     dataset in the same location.
Leave the remaining default settings as they are, and click
Create dataset
.
Download the source data file
The file that you're downloading contains approximately 7 MB of data about
popular baby names. It's provided by the US Social Security Administration.
For more information about the dataset, see the
Social Security Administration's dataset information page
.
Download the US Social Security Administration's dataset by opening the
following URL in a new browser tab:
https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/names.zip
Extract the file.
For more information about the dataset schema, see the zip file's
NationalReadMe.pdf
file.
To see what the data looks like, open the
yob2014.txt
file. This file
contains comma-separated values for name, assigned sex at birth, and number
of children with that name. The file has no header row.
Note the location of the
yob2014.txt
file so that you can find it later.
Load data into a table
Next, load the data into a new table.
In the
Explorer
panel, click your project name.

The name cannot start with a number or underscore,
and it cannot have spaces.
Confirm that the dataset
babynames
now appears in your project:
bq ls
The output is similar to the following:
datasetId
-------------
  babynames
Load data into a table
In the
babynames
dataset, load the source file
yob2010.txt
into a
new table that's named
names2010
:
bq load babynames.names2010 yob2010.txt name:string,assigned_sex_at_birth:string,count:integer
The output is similar to the following:
Upload complete.
Waiting on bqjob_r3c045d7cbe5ca6d2_0000018292f0815f_1 ... (1s) Current status: DONE
By default, when you load data, BigQuery expects UTF-8
encoded data. If you have data in ISO-8859-1 (or Latin-1) encoding and
you have problems with it, instruct BigQuery to treat
your data as Latin-1 using
bq load -E=ISO-8859-1
. For more information,
see
Encoding
.
Confirm that the table
names2010
now appears in the
babynames
dataset:
bq ls babynames
The output is similar to the following. Some columns are omitted to simplify
the output.
tableId     Type
----------- ---------
 names2010    TABLE
Confirm that the table schema of your new
names2010
table is
name: string
,
assigned_sex_at_birth: string
, and
count: integer
:
bq show babynames.names2010
The output is similar to the following. Some columns are omitted to simplify
the output.

Make sure that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project
.
If you do not enable billing for the Google Cloud project that you use in this
tutorial, then you will work with data in the BigQuery sandbox. The
BigQuery sandbox lets you learn BigQuery with a limited
set of BigQuery features at no charge.
Ensure that the BigQuery API is enabled.
Enable the API
If you created a new project, the BigQuery API is automatically
    enabled.
In the Google Cloud console, activate Cloud Shell.
Activate Cloud Shell
At the bottom of the Google Cloud console, a
Cloud Shell
session starts and displays a command-line prompt. Cloud Shell is a shell environment
      with the Google Cloud CLI
      already installed and with values already set for
      your current project. It can take a few seconds for the session to initialize.
Download the source public data file
Download the
baby names zip file
.
Extract the zip file. It contains a file named
NationalReadMe.pdf
that
describes the dataset schema.

.
Open the
yob2010.txt
file. It's a comma-separated value (CSV) file that
contains three columns: name, assigned sex at birth, and number of children
with that name. The file has no header row.
Move the file to your working directory.

If you're working in a local shell, copy or move the file
yob2010.txt
into the directory where you're running the bq tool.
Create a dataset
Create a dataset named
babynames
:
bq mk babynames
The output is similar to the following:
Dataset 'myproject:babynames' successfully created.
A dataset name can be up to 1,024 characters long and consist of A-Z, a-z,
0-9, and the underscore. The name cannot start with a number or underscore,
and it cannot have spaces.
