If you want to use
ML.GENERATE_TEXT
with a
gemini-pro-vision
model in order
to analyze visual content in an object table, you must have an
Enterprise or Enterprise Plus reservation
.

Create reservations
.
Create a connection
Create a
Cloud resource connection
and get the connection's service account.
Select one of the following options:
Console
Go to the
BigQuery
page.
Go to BigQuery
To create a connection, click
add
Add
, and then click
Connections to external data sources
.
In the
Connection type
list, select
Vertex AI remote models,
remote functions and BigLake (Cloud Resource)
.
In the
Connection ID
field, enter a name for your
connection.
Click
Create connection
.
Click
Go to connection
.
In the
Connection info
pane, copy the service account ID for use in a
later step.
bq
In a command-line environment, create a connection:
bq mk --connection --location=
REGION
--project_id=
PROJECT_ID
\
    --connection_type=CLOUD_RESOURCE
CONNECTION_ID
The
--project_id
parameter overrides the default project.
Replace the following:
REGION
: your
connection region
PROJECT_ID
: your Google Cloud project ID
CONNECTION_ID
: an ID for your
connection
When you create a connection resource, BigQuery creates a
unique system service account and associates it with the connection.
Troubleshooting
: If you get the following connection error,
update the Google Cloud SDK
:
Flags parsing error: flag --connection_type=CLOUD_RESOURCE: value should be one of...
Retrieve and copy the service account ID for use in a later
step:
bq show --connection
PROJECT_ID
.
REGION
.
CONNECTION_ID
The output is similar to the following:
name                          properties
1234.

Go to IAM & Admin
Click

Grant Access
.
In the
New principals
field, enter the service account ID that you
copied earlier.
In the
Select a role
field, choose

.
Click

.
Create the remote model
Create a remote model that represents a hosted Vertex AI
large language model (LLM):
SQL
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
BigQuery
page.
Go to BigQuery
In the query editor, run the following statement:
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `bqml_tutorial.llm_model`
REMOTE WITH CONNECTION `
LOCATION
.
CONNECTION_ID
`
OPTIONS (ENDPOINT = 'text-bison');
Replace the following:
LOCATION
: the connection location
CONNECTION_ID
: the ID of your
BigQuery connection
When you
view the connection details
in the Google Cloud console, this is the value in the last section of
  the fully qualified connection ID that is shown in
Connection ID
, for example
projects/myproject/locations/connection_location/connections/
myconnection
The query takes several seconds to complete, after which the model
llm_model
appears in the
bqml_tutorial
dataset in the
Explorer
pane.
Because the query uses a
CREATE MODEL
statement to create a model, there
are no query results.
BigQuery DataFrames
Before trying this sample, follow the BigQuery DataFrames
    setup instructions in the
BigQuery quickstart
    using BigQuery DataFrames
.
    For more information, see the
BigQuery DataFrames reference documentation
.
To authenticate to BigQuery, set up Application Default Credentials.
    For more information, see
Set 
    up authentication for a local development environment

Before you begin
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
        select or
create a Google Cloud project
.
Note
: If you don't plan to keep the
    resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
    selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
    delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Go to project selector
Make sure that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project
.
Enable the BigQuery, BigQuery Connection, and Vertex AI APIs.
Enable the APIs
Create a dataset
Create a BigQuery dataset to store your ML model:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.
Go to the BigQuery page
In the
Explorer
pane, click your project name.
Click
more_vert
View actions > Create dataset
.
On the
Create dataset
page, do the following:
For
Dataset ID
, enter
bqml_tutorial
.
For
Location type
, select
Multi-region
, and then select
US (multiple regions in United States)
.
The public datasets are stored in the
US
multi-region
. For simplicity,
store your dataset in the same location.
Leave the remaining default settings as they are, and click
Create dataset
.
Create a connection
Create a
Cloud resource connection
and get the connection's service account. Create the connection in
the same
location
as the dataset you created in the
previous step.
Select one of the following options:
Console
Go to the
BigQuery
page.
Go to BigQuery
To create a connection, click
add

bq
In a command-line environment, create a connection:
bq mk --connection --location=
REGION
--project_id=
PROJECT_ID
\
    --connection_type=CLOUD_RESOURCE
CONNECTION_ID
The
--project_id
parameter overrides the default project.
Replace the following:
REGION
: your
connection region
PROJECT_ID
: your Google Cloud project ID
CONNECTION_ID
: an ID for your
connection
When you create a connection resource, BigQuery creates a
unique system service account and associates it with the connection.
Troubleshooting
: If you get the following connection error,
update the Google Cloud SDK
:
Flags parsing error: flag --connection_type=CLOUD_RESOURCE: value should be one of...
Retrieve and copy the service account ID for use in a later
step:
bq show --connection
PROJECT_ID
.
REGION
.
CONNECTION_ID
The output is similar to the following:
name                          properties
1234.
REGION
.
CONNECTION_ID
{"serviceAccountId": "connection-1234-9u56h9@gcp-sa-bigquery-condel.iam.gserviceaccount.com"}
Terraform
Append the following section into your
main.tf
file.
## This creates a cloud resource connection.
 ## Note: The cloud resource nested object has only one output only field - serviceAccountId.
 resource "google_bigquery_connection" "connection" {
    connection_id = "
CONNECTION_ID
"
    project = "
PROJECT_ID
"
    location = "
REGION
"
    cloud_resource {}
}
Replace the following:
CONNECTION_ID
: an ID for your
connection
PROJECT_ID
: your Google Cloud project ID
REGION
: your
connection region
Grant permissions to the connection's service account
To grant the connection's service account appropriate roles to access
the Cloud Storage and Vertex AI services, follow these steps:
Go to the
IAM & Admin
page.
