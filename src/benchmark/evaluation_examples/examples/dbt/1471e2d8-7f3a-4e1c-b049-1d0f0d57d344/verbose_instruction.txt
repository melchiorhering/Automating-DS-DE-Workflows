This task requires you to write some sql codes to select a certain column.
1. Open the file ``models/dim_customers.sql`` in the VSCode editor.
2. Append the following SQL codes in the select block (there is a comment indicating the target location).
```sql
    coalesce (regexp_matches(
        customers.email, '^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}$'
    )
    = true
    and accepted_email_domains.tld is not null,
    false) as is_valid_email_address
from customers
    left join accepted_email_domains
    on customers.email_top_level_domain = lower(accepted_email_domains.tld)
```
3. Switch to the terminal.
4. Run ``dbt build`` to load the seeds and execute the models.
