Build models on top of other models
​
As a best practice in SQL, you should separate logic that cleans up your data from logic that transforms your data. You have already started doing this in the existing query by using common table expressions (CTEs).
Now you can experiment by separating the logic out into separate models and using the
ref
function to build models on top of other models:
The DAG we want for our dbt project
Create a new SQL file,
models/stg_customers.sql
, with the SQL from the
customers
CTE in our original query.
Create a second new SQL file,
models/stg_orders.sql
, with the SQL from the
orders
CTE in our original query.
