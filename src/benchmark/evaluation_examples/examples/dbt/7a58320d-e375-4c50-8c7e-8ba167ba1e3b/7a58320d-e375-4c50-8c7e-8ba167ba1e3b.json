    "instruction": "Create a dbt project jaffle_shop in ~/projects, connect it to duckdb at jaffle_shop.duckdb for both dev and prod targets, and load data from jaffle-shop-data.zip with dbt seed.\nHere is a step-by-step tutorial from an expert instructing you how to complete it:\nThis is a common dbt-core initialization task. To complete this, you need to:\n1. Switch to the terminal.\n2. Run ``dbt init jaffle_shop`` to initiate a project named \"jaffle_shop\".\n3. If the terminal asks you which database to use, enter \"1\" to choose duckdb.\n4. Run ``unzip jaffle-shop-data.zip`` to unzip the data files.\n5. Run ``mv jaffle-shop-data/* jaffle_shop/seeds`` to move the seeds to the folder \"/jaffle_shop/seeds\".\n6. Run ``vi ~/.dbt/profiles.yml`` to open the project profile in VI editor.\n7. Switch to the insert mode in VI editor by pressing the key \"i\".\n8. Replace the default values for both ``dev`` and ``prod`` fields to \"jaffle_shop.duckdb\".\n9. Back to the normal mode by pressing the key \"esc\".\n10. Enter the command ``:wq`` to save the changes.\n11. Run ``cd jaffle_shop`` to navigate into the project directory.\n12. Run ``dbt debug`` to connect to the database at jaffle_shop.duckdb.\n13. Run ``dbt seed`` to load the seeds.\nYou can exactly follow the detailed plan above or proactively tackle the task based on the real-time environment interaction by yourself.",
