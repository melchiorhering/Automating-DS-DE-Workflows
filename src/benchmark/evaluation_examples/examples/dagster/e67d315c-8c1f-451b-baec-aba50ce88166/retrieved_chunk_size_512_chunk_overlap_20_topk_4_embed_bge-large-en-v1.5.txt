4. Orchestrating with Dagster
Dagster
is a modern data orchestrator designed to help you build, test, and monitor your data workflows. In this section, we'll walk you through setting up Dagster to oversee both the Airbyte and dbt workflows:
Navigate to the Orchestration Directory
:
Switch to the directory containing the Dagster orchestration configurations:
cd ../orchestration
Set Environment Variables
:
Dagster requires certain environment variables to be set to interact with other tools like dbt and Airbyte. Set the following variables:
export DAGSTER_DBT_PARSE_PROJECT_ON_LOAD=1
export AIRBYTE_PASSWORD=password
Note: The AIRBYTE_PASSWORD is set to password as a default for local Airbyte instances. If you've changed this during your Airbyte setup, ensure you use the appropriate password here.
Launch the Dagster UI
:
With the environment variables in place, kick-start the Dagster UI:
dagster dev
Access Dagster in Your Browser
:
Open your browser and navigate to
http://127.0.0.1:3000
. There, you should see assets for both Airbyte and dbt. To get an overview of how these assets interrelate, click on "view global asset lineage". This will give you a clear picture of the data lineage, visualizing how data flows between the tools.
Next Steps
Once you've set up and launched this initial integration, the real power lies in its adaptability and extensibility. Here‚Äôs a roadmap to help you customize and harness this project tailored to your specific data needs:
Add more Data(base) sources
:
You can add more databases or data sources from Airbyte's
source catalogue
. To do this, edit the Terraform source_databases module and create a new connection in the connections module for each source added.
Create dbt Sources for Airbyte Data
:
Your raw data extracted via Airbyte can be represented as sources in dbt. Start by
creating new dbt sources
to represent this data, allowing for structured transformations down the line.
Add Your dbt Transformations
:
With your dbt sources in place, you can now build upon them.

Verify generated components in Airbyte UI
Let's look at the Airbyte UI before we apply anything.
Before I applied the changes, only my manual added connections.
After applying the changes, <span class="text-style-code">fetch_stargazer</span> popped up with its corresponding GitHub source and Postgres destination.
After we applied the Dagster Python configurations
üìù This is equivalent to going into the Airbyte UI and setting up the source and destination with clicks.
Set up Dagster Software Defined Assets
Software-Defined Asset
in Dagster treats each of our destination tables from Airbyte as a
Data Product
‚Äîenabling the control plane to see the latest status of each
Data Asset
and its valuable metadata.
We can set them up with a little bit of code in Dagster. As we created the Airbyte components with Dagster already, Dagster has all the information already:
airbyte_assets = load_assets_from_connections(
    airbyte=airbyte_instance,
    connections=[stargazer_connection],
    key_prefix=["postgres"],
)
The same we do for our dbt project that is under
dbt_transformation
.

Aggregating Data from MySQL and Postgres into BigQuery with Airbyte | Airbyte

Documentation Content:
Add your custom SQL transformations in dbt, ensuring that you treat the sources as an upstream dependency. This ensures that your transformations work on the most up-to-date raw data.
Execute the Pipeline in Dagster
:
Navigate to the Dagster UI and click on "Materialize all". This triggers the entire pipeline, encompassing the extraction via Airbyte, transformations via dbt, and any other subsequent steps.
Extend the Project
:
The real beauty of this integration is its extensibility. Whether you want to add more data sources, integrate additional tools, or enhance your transformation logic ‚Äì the floor is yours. With the foundation set, sky's the limit for how you want to extend and refine your data processes.
