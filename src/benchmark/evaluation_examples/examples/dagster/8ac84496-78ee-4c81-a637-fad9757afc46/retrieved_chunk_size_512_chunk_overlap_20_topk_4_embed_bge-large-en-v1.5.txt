Step 5.1: Create the Iris dataset asset
#
To create an asset for the Iris dataset, add the following code to
/tutorial_template/assets/__init__.py
:
# /tutorial_template/assets/__init__.py
from
dagstermill
import
define_dagstermill_asset
from
dagster
import
asset
,
file_relative_path
import
pandas
as
pd
@asset
(
group_name
=
"template_tutorial"
)
def
iris_dataset
(
)
:
return
pd
.
read_csv
(
"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data"
,
names
=
[
"Sepal length (cm)"
,
"Sepal width (cm)"
,
"Petal length (cm)"
,
"Petal width (cm)"
,
"Species"
,
]
,
)
If you're following along in the template tutorial, uncomment the code block under the
TODO 2
comment.
Let's go over what's happening in this code block:
Using
@asset
, we create a standard Dagster asset. The name of the Python function (
iris_dataset
) is the name of the asset.
As with the
iris_kmeans_jupyter
asset, we set the
group_name
parameter to organize our assets in the UI.
The body of the Python function fetches the Iris dataset, renames the columns, and outputs a Pandas DataFrame.
Step 5.2: Provide the iris_dataset asset to the notebook asset
#
Next, we need to tell Dagster that the
iris_datset
asset is input data for the
iris-kmeans
notebook.

Documentation Title:
Using Jupyter notebooks with Papermill and Dagster Tutorial

Documentation Content:
The page will display the notebook asset in the
Asset Graph
.
If you click the notebook asset, a sidebar containing info about the asset will slide out from the right side of the page. In the
Description
section of the panel is a
View Source Notebook
button:
This button allows you to view the notebook directly in the UI. When clicked, Dagster will render the notebook - referenced in the
notebook_path
parameter - that'll be executed when the
iris_kmeans_jupyter
asset is materialized:
Click the
Materialize
button. To view the execution as it happens, click the
View
button in the alert that displays.
After the run completes successfully, you can view the executed notebook in the UI. Click the asset again and locate the
View Notebook
button in the
Materialization in Last Run
section of the sidebar:
Click the button to display the executed notebook - specifically, the notebook that was executed and written to a persistent location:
Step 5: Add an upstream asset
#
While our
iris-kmeans
notebook asset now materializes successfully, there are still some improvements we can make. The beginning of the notebook fetches the Iris dataset, which means that every time the notebook is materialized, the data is re-fetched.
To address this, we can factor the Iris dataset into its own asset. This will allow us to:
Use the asset as input to additional notebooks.
This means all notebooks analyzing the Iris dataset will use the same source data, which we only have to fetch once.
Materialize notebooks without fetching data for each materialization.
Instead of making potentially expensive API calls, Dagster can fetch the data from the previous materialization of the Iris dataset and provide that data as input to the notebook.

Documentation Title:
Using Jupyter notebooks with Papermill and Dagster Tutorial

Documentation Content:
To do this, add the
ins
parameter to the notebook asset:
# tutorial_template/assets/__init__.py
from
dagstermill
import
define_dagstermill_asset
from
dagster
import
asset
,
file_relative_path
,
AssetIn
import
pandas
as
pd
# iris_dataset asset removed for clarity
iris_kmeans_jupyter_notebook
=
define_dagstermill_asset
(
name
=
"iris_kmeans_jupyter"
,
notebook_path
=
file_relative_path
(
__file__
,
"../notebooks/iris-kmeans.ipynb"
)
,
group_name
=
"template_tutorial"
,
ins
=
{
"iris"
:
AssetIn
(
"iris_dataset"
)
}
,
# this is the new parameter!
)
If you are following along with the template tutorial, uncomment the line with the
TODO 3
comment.
The
ins
parameter tells Dagster that the
iris_dataset
asset should be mapped to a variable named
iris
in our notebook. Recall that in our
iris-kmeans
notebook, the Iris dataset is assigned to a variable named
iris
.
Step 5.3: Modify the notebook
#
We need to make a small change in our Jupyter notebook to allow Dagster to supply the
iris_dataset
asset as input. Behind the scenes, Dagster uses
papermill
to inject parameters into notebooks.
papermill
works by replacing a notebook cell with the
parameters
tag with a custom cell that can fetch the desired data.
To accomplish this, we need to tag the cell in the
iris-kmeans
notebook that fetches the Iris dataset. This allows us to replace the cell with the data-fetching logic that loads the
iris_dataset
asset and retain the ability to run the Jupyter notebook in a standalone context. We'll cover this in more detail later in the tutorial.

We'll address this in the remainder of the tutorial.
Step 2: Create a Dagster asset from the Jupyter Notebook
#
By creating a Dagster asset from our notebook, we can integrate the notebook as part of our data platform. This enables us to make its contents more accessible to developers, stakeholders, and other assets in Dagster.
To create a Dagster asset from a Jupyter notebook, we can use the
define_dagstermill_asset
function. In
/tutorial_template/assets/__init__.py
add the following code snippet:
# /tutorial_template/assets/__init__.py
from
dagstermill
import
define_dagstermill_asset
from
dagster
import
file_relative_path

iris_kmeans_jupyter_notebook
=
define_dagstermill_asset
(
name
=
"iris_kmeans_jupyter"
,
notebook_path
=
file_relative_path
(
__file__
,
"../notebooks/iris-kmeans.ipynb"
)
,
group_name
=
"template_tutorial"
,
)
If you are following along in the template code, uncomment the code block under the
TODO 1
comment.
Using
define_dagstermill_asset
, we've created and returned a Dagster asset. Let's take a look at the arguments we provided:
name
- This argument names the asset, in this case
iris_kmeans_jupyter
notebook_path
- This argument tells Dagster where to find the notebook the asset should use as a source. In this case, that's our
/notebooks/iris-kmeans.ipynb
file.
group_name
- This optional argument places the asset into a group named
template_tutorial
, which is helpful for organizating your assets in the UI.
When materialized, the
iris_kmeans_jupyter
asset will execute the notebook (
/notebooks/iris-kmeans.ipynb
) and store the resulting
.ipynb
file in a persistent location.
Step 3: Add a Dagster Definitions object and supply an I/O manager
#
We want to execute our Dagster asset and save the resulting notebook to a persistent location.
