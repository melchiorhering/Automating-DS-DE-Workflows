!

Before I applied the changes, only my manual added connections.

After applying the changes, fetch\_stargazer popped up with its corresponding GitHub source and Postgres destination.

After we applied the Dagster Python configurations

üìù This is equivalent to going into the Airbyte UI and setting up the source and destination with clicks.

Set up Dagster Software Defined Assets
--------------------------------------

Software-Defined Assetin Dagster treats each of our destination tables from Airbyte as a Data Product‚Äîenabling the control plane to see the latest status of each Data Assetand its valuable metadata.

We can set them up with a little bit of code in Dagster. As we created the Airbyte components with Dagster already, Dagster has all the information already:

`airbyte_assets = load_assets_from_connections(
 airbyte=airbyte_instance,
 connections=[stargazer_connection],
 key_prefix=["postgres"],
)`The same we do for our dbt project that is underdbt\_transformation. The dbt projects create a mart\_gh\_cumulative view on top of our replicated GitHub tables, which we can visualize with Metabase later.

Documentation Title:
Using the Dagster Integration | Airbyte Documentation

Documentation Content:
Creating a simple Dagster DAG to run an Airbyte Sync Job‚Äã

Create a new folder called `airbyte_dagster`and create a file `airbyte_dagster.py`.

`fromdagster importjobfromdagster_airbyte importairbyte_resource,airbyte_sync_opmy_airbyte_resource =airbyte_resource.configured({"host":{"env":"AIRBYTE_HOST"},"port":{"env":"AIRBYTE_PORT"},})sync_foobar =airbyte_sync_op.configured({"connection_id":"your-connection-uuid"},name="sync_foobar")@job(resource_defs={"airbyte":my_airbyte_resource})defmy_simple_airbyte_job():sync_foobar()`The Airbyte Dagster Resource accepts the following parameters:

* `host`: The host URL to your Airbyte instance.
* `port`: The port value you have selected for your Airbyte instance.
* `use_https`: If your server use secure HTTP connection.
* `request_max_retries`: The maximum number of times requests to the Airbyte API should be retried before failing.
* `request_retry_delay`: Time in seconds to wait between each request retry.

The Airbyte Dagster Op accepts the following parameters:

* `connection_id`: The Connection UUID you want to trigger
* `poll_interval`: The time in seconds that will be waited between successive polls.
* `poll_timeout`: he maximum time that will waited before this operation is timed out.

After running the file, `dagster job execute -f airbyte_dagster.py` this will trigger the job with Dagster.

That's it!‚Äã
-----------

Don't be fooled by our simple example of only one Dagster Flow. Airbyte is a powerful data integration platform supporting many sources and destinations. The Airbyte Dagster Integration means Airbyte can now be easily used with the Dagster ecosystem - give it a shot!

We love to hear any questions or feedback on our Slack. We're still in alpha, so if you see any rough edges or want to request a connector, feel free to create an issue on our Githubor thumbs up an existing issue.

Aggregating Data from MySQL and Postgres into BigQuery with Airbyte | Airbyte

Documentation Content:
Update this file with your BigQuery connection details.

**3. Utilize Environment Variables (Optional but Recommended)**:

To keep your credentials secure, you can leverage environment variables. An example is provided within the profiles.yml file.

**4. Test the Connection**:

Once you‚Äôve updated the connection details, you can test the connection to your BigQuery instance using:

`dbt debug`If everything is set up correctly, this command should report a successful connection to BigQuery.

4. Orchestrating with Dagster
-----------------------------

Dagsteris a modern data orchestrator designed to help you build, test, and monitor your data workflows. In this section, we'll walk you through setting up Dagster to oversee both the Airbyte and dbt workflows:

**Navigate to the Orchestration Directory**:

Switch to the directory containing the Dagster orchestration configurations:

`cd ../orchestration`**Set Environment Variables**:

Dagster requires certain environment variables to be set to interact with other tools like dbt and Airbyte. Set the following variables:

`export DAGSTER_DBT_PARSE_PROJECT_ON_LOAD=1
export AIRBYTE_PASSWORD=password`Note: The AIRBYTE\_PASSWORD is set to password as a default for local Airbyte instances. If you've changed this during your Airbyte setup, ensure you use the appropriate password here.

**Launch the Dagster UI**:

With the environment variables in place, kick-start the Dagster UI:

`dagster dev`**Access Dagster in Your Browser**:

Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:3000. There, you should see assets for both Airbyte and dbt. To get an overview of how these assets interrelate, click on "view global asset lineage". This will give you a clear picture of the data lineage, visualizing how data flows between the tools.

Next Steps
----------

Once you've set up and launched this initial integration, the real power lies in its adaptability and extensibility.

Documentation Title:
How to implement AI data pipeline?: Langchain, Dagster & Airbyte | Airbyte

Documentation Content:
Prerequisites
-------------

To run, you need:

* Python 3 and Docker installed locally
* An OpenAI api key

Install a bunch of Python dependencies we‚Äôll need to go forward:

`pip install openai faiss-cpu requests beautifulsoup4 tiktoken dagster_managed_elements langchain dagster dagster-airbyte dagit`Step 1: Set up the the Airbyte connection
-----------------------------------------

First, start Airbyte locally, as described on https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte#quick-start.

Set up a connection:

* Configure a source - if you don‚Äôt have sample data ready, you can use the ‚ÄúSample Data (Faker)‚Äù data source
* Configure a ‚ÄúLocal JSON‚Äù destination with path /local - dagster will pick up the data from there
* Configure a connection from your configured source to the local json destination. Set the ‚ÄúReplication frequency‚Äù to manual as Dagster will take care of running the sync at the right point in time.
* To keep things simple, only enable a single stream of records (in my case, I chose the ‚ÄúAccount‚Äù stream from the Salesforce source)

!Step 2: Configure the Dagster pipeline
--------------------------------------

Configure the software-defined assets for dagster in a new file ingest.py:

First, load the existing Airbyte connection as Dagster asset (no need to define manually). The *load\_assets\_from\_airbyte\_instance*function will use the API to fetch existing connections from your Airbyte instance and make them available as assets that can be specified as dependencies to the python-defined assets processing the records in the subsequent steps.

`from dagster_airbyte import load_assets_from_airbyte_instance, AirbyteResource

airbyte_instance = AirbyteResource(
 host="localhost",
 port="8000",
)

airbyte_assets = load_assets_from_airbyte_instance(
 airbyte_instance,
 key_prefix="airbyte_asset",
)`Then, add the LangChain loader to turn the raw jsonl file into LangChain documents as a dependent asset (set stream\_name to the name of the stream of records in Airbyte you want to make accessible to the LLM - in my case it‚Äôs *Account*):

`from langchain.
