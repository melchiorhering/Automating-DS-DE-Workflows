We want to add some tests to this project to make sure the materialization of the assets is correct. Please follow these steps:
1. Open the file "test_assets.py" in the VS Code editor.
2. Add the following code to "test_assets.py":
```
from dagster import materialize
from harry_potter_potions.assets import all_potions, count_advanced_difficulty_potions

def test_potions_assets():
    assets = [all_potions, count_advanced_difficulty_potions]
    result = materialize(assets)
    assert result.success
    cnt = result.output_for_node("count_advanced_difficulty_potions")
    assert cnt == 14
```
3. Save the current file.
4. Switch to the terminal. Go to the directory /home/user/harry-potter-potions/.
5. Run the command "pytest harry_potter_potions_tests" to ensure that the tests are added correctly.
