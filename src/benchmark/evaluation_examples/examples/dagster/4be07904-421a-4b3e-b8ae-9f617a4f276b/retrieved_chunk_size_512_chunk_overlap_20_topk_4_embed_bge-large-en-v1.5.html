By using Dagster to monitor performance changes and process failures on your ML model, it becomes possible to set up remediation paths, such as automated model retraining, that can help resolve issues like model drift.</p><p>In this example, the model is being evaluated against the previous model’s accuracy. If the model’s accuracy has improved, the model is returned for use in downstream steps, such as inference or deploying to production.</p><code><span>from</span>sklearn <span>import</span>linear_model

While Dagster allows you to refresh a machine learning model as often as you like, best practice is to re-train as seldomly as possible. Model retraining can be costly to compute and having a minimal number of model versions can reduce the complexity of reproducing results at a later point in time. In this case, the model is updated once a week for <code>predictions</code>, ensuring that <code>my_ml_model</code>is retrained before it is used.</p><code><span>from</span>dagster <span>import</span>AutoMaterializePolicy<span>,</span>FreshnessPolicy<span>,</span>asset
