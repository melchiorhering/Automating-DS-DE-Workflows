Documentation Title:
Asset checks | Dagster

Documentation Content:
With asset checks, you can also:

* Block downstream execution based on check results
* Use severity levels and metadata to communicate actionable details about check results in the UI
* Use freshness checks to identify stale assets that are due for a refresh
* **Dagster+ only**: Create alerts based on asset check results

Limitations#
------------

**Dagster's UI is tested with a maximum of 1000 checks per asset.**It's designed with the expectation that most assets will have fewer than 50 checks. If you have a use case that doesn't fit these limits, reach out to Dagster support to discuss.

**Checks are currently only supported per-asset, not per-partition.**See this issuefor updates.

===============

Creating testable and verifiable data pipelines is one of the focuses of Dagster. We believe ensuring data quality is critical for managing the complexity of data systems. Here, we'll cover how to write unit tests for individual assets, as well as for graphs of assets together.

Prerequisites#
--------------

This guide builds off of the project written in the tutorial. If you haven't already, you should complete the tutorial before continuing. Other guides may also build off the project created in the tutorial, but for this guide, we'll assume that the Dagster project is the same as the one created in the tutorial.

It also assumes that you have installed a test runner like pytest.

Testing an individual asset#
----------------------------

We'll start by writing a test for the `topstories_word_cloud`asset definition, which is an image of a word cloud of the titles of top stories on Hacker News. To run the function that derives an asset from its upstream dependencies, we can invoke it directly, as if it's a regular Python function.

Add the following code to the `test_assets.py`file in your `tutorial_project_tests`directory:

`importpandas aspd
fromtutorial_project.assets importtopstories_word_cloud

deftest_topstories_word_cloud():df =pd.DataFrame([{"title":"Wow, Dagster is such an awesome and amazing product. I can't wait to use it!"},{"title":"Pied Piper launches new product"},])results =topstories_word_cloud(df)assertresults isnotNone# It returned something`Testing a graph of assets#
--------------------------

We'll also write a test for all the assets together.

Documentation Content:
Testing multiple assets together

You may want to test multiple assets together, to more closely mirror actual materialization. This can be done using the `materialize_to_memory`method, which loads the materialized results of assets into memory:

`fromdagster importasset,materialize_to_memory


@assetdefdata_source():returnget_data_from_source()@assetdefstructured_data(data_source):returnextract_structured_data(data_source)# An example unit test using materialize_to_memorydeftest_data_assets():result =materialize_to_memory([data_source,structured_data])assertresult.success
 # Materialized objects can be accessed in terms of the underlying opmaterialized_data =result.output_for_node("structured_data")...`Mock resources can be provided directly using `materialize_to_memory`:

`fromdagster importasset,materialize_to_memory,ConfigurableResource
importmock


classMyServiceResource(ConfigurableResource):...@assetdefasset_requires_service(service:MyServiceResource):...@assetdefother_asset_requires_service(service:MyServiceResource):...deftest_assets_require_service():# Mock objects can be provided directly.result =materialize_to_memory([asset_requires_service,other_asset_requires_service],resources={"service":mock.MagicMock()},)assertresult.success
 ...`Testing asset checks#
---------------------

Functions decorated with `@asset_check`can be directly invoked. For example:

`importpandas aspd

fromdagster importAssetCheckResult,asset_check

Documentation Content:
To do that, we can put them in a list and then pass it to the `materialize`function. That returns an `ExecuteInProcessResult`object, whose methods let us investigate, in detail, the success or failure of execution, the values produced by the computation, and other events associated with execution.

Update the `test_assets.py`file to include the following code:

`fromdagster importmaterialize
fromtutorial_project.assets import(topstory_ids,topstories,topstories_word_cloud
)# Instead of importing one asset, import them alldeftest_hackernews_assets():assets =[topstory_ids,topstories,topstories_word_cloud]result =materialize(assets)assertresult.success
 df =result.output_for_node("topstories")assertlen(df)==100`Running the tests#
------------------

Use pytest, or your test runner of choice, to run the unit tests. Navigate to the top-level `tutorial_project`directory (the one that contains the `tutorial_project_tests`directory) and run:

`pytest tutorial_project_tests`Wait a few seconds for the tests to run and observe the output in your terminal.
