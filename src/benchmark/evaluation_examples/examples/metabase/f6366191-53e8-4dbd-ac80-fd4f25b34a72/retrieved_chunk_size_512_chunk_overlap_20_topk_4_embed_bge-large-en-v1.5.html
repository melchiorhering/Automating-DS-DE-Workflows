</code><p>After our Metabase instances complete their initialization (patience, this could take a minute or two), we should now have two Metabases up and running:</p><ul><li>metabase-source at <code>http://localhost:5001</code></li><li>metabase-target at <code>http://localhost:5002</code></li></ul><h3>Add users to our source Metabase</h3><p>Let’s add one Admin account, and two basic users to our metabase-source instance.</p><p>You can <a>add users to your Metabase manually</a>(i.e. in the Metabase application), but here’s a quick bash script that creates an Admin user (the initial user) and two basic users:</p><p>You’ll need to have <a>jq</a>installed to handle the JSON in this script.</p><code><span>#!/bin/sh</span><span>ADMIN_EMAIL</span><span>=</span><span>${</span><span>MB_ADMIN_EMAIL</span><span>:-</span><span>admin</span><span>@metabase.

You can even add our trusty <a>Sample Database</a>as a new database to your instance with <code>POST /api/database/sample_database</code>.</p><p>Here’s an example database creation call for a <a>Redshift</a>database.</p><code>curl <span>-s</span><span>-X</span>POST <span>\</span><span>-H</span><span>"Content-type: application/json"</span><span>\</span><span>-H</span><span>'x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY'</span><span>\</span>http://localhost:3000/api/database <span>\</span><span>-d</span><span>'{

        "name": "Redshift",
        "details": {
            "host": "redshift.aws.com",

            "user": "root",
            "password": "password"
        }
    }'</span></code><h3>Set up users, groups, and permissions</h3><p>You can use the <code>/api/user</code>endpoints to create, update, and disable users, or the <code>/api/permissions</code>endpoints to set up groups or <a>add users to them</a>. Here’s an example curl command to create a user:</p><code>curl <span>-s</span><span>"http://localhost:3000/api/user"</span><span>\</span><span>-H</span><span>'Content-Type: application/json'</span><span>\</span><span>-H</span><span>'x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY'</span><span>\</span><span>-d</span><span>'{
    "first_name":"Basic",
    "last_name":"Person",
    "email":"basic@somewhere.com",
    "password":"Sup3rS3cure_:}"
}'</span></code><h3>Generate reports</h3><p>In Metabase, “reports” are referred to as <a>dashboards</a>. You can interact with dashboards using the <code>/api/dashboard</code>endpoint.
