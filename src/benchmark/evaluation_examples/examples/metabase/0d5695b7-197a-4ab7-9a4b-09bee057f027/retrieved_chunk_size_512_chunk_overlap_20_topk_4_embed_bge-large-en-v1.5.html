Documentation Title:
The SQL editor

Documentation Content:
You can also run only part of a query by highlighting the part you’d like to run before clicking the run button or using the run shortcut key.</p><p>Questions asked using SQL can be saved, downloaded, converted to models, and added to dashboards just like questions asked using the query builder.</p><p>You can also <a>refer to models and saved questions</a>in your SQL queries.</p><h2>Using SQL filters</h2><p>If you or someone else wrote a SQL query that includes <a>variables</a>, that question might have filter widgets at the top of the screen above the editor. Filter widgets let you modify the SQL query before it’s run, changing the results you might get.</p><p>Writing SQL queries that use variables or parameters can be very powerful, but it’s also a bit more advanced, so that topic has its own page if you’d like to <a>learn more</a>.</p><h2>SQL snippets</h2><p>You can use <a>SQL snippets</a>to save, reuse, and share SQL code across multiple questions that are composed using the SQL editor.</p><h2>How Metabase executes SQL queries</h2><p>When you run a query from the SQL editor, Metabase sends the query to your database exactly as it is written. Any results or errors displayed in Metabase are the same as the results or errors that you would get if you ran the query directly against your database. If the SQL syntax of your query doesn’t match the SQL dialect used by your database, your database won’t be able to run the query.</p><h2>Question version history</h2><p>For questions, <a>dashboards</a>, and <a>models</a>, Metabase keeps a version history for the previous fifteen versions of that item.</p><p>See <a>History</a>.</p><h2>Your SQL syntax must match the dialect used by the database</h2><p>Make sure your SQL dialect matches the database you’ve selected.

For questions written in SQL, you can use variables in your code to create <a>SQL templates</a>, including <a>field filter</a>variables that can create smart dropdown filters.</p><p>Like query builder questions, you can use the results of models or <a>saved questions</a>as starting points for new questions, just as you would a table or view. For example, to reference question 123 like so:</p><code><span>WITH</span><span>gizmo_orders</span><span>AS</span><span>#</span><span>{</span><span>123</span><span>}</span></code><h3>Create models to use as starting data for new questions</h3><p><a>Models</a>are built with questions from either the query builder or the SQL editor. You can use them to pull together data from multiple tables, with custom, calculated columns, and column descriptions and other metadata, to create great starting data for people to ask new questions. For example, you could build a model for “Active users”, or “Priority orders”, or however you want to model your business.</p><p>If you find that you’re using the same saved question over and over as your starting data for new questions, you may want to convert that saved question to a model, which will let you add metadata like column descriptions and column types. You can also refer to models in SQL queries, just like we did above with saved questions.</p><h3>Upload spreadsheets</h3><p>You can <a>upload CSVs</a>to query and visualize in Metabase. This feature is handy for quick ad hoc analysis of spreadsheet data.</p><h3>Visualize results</h3><p>When you ask a question, Metabase will guess at the most appropriate visualization type for the results, but you can select from sixteen different visualization options.</p><p>Additionally, each visualization type has their own set of options to customize.

Metabase lets you ask questions about your data, and displays answers in formats that make sense, whether that’s a bar chart or a detailed table.</p><p>You can save your questions, and group questions into handsome dashboards. Metabase also makes it easy to share questions and dashboards with the rest of your team.</p><p>At a high level, we’ll walk through the features that let you:</p><ul><a>Query and visualize your data</a><a>Create, update, and delete records</a><a>Embed charts and share your results</a><a>Find things and stay organized</a><a>Customize Metabase</a></ul><h2>Query and visualize your data</h2><p>Metabase supports a <a>lot of different databases</a>, and ships with a <a>Sample Database</a>for you to play around with. And once you’ve connected your data sources, Metabase gives you a lot of tools to explore them.</p><h3>Ask questions</h3><h4>Query builder</h4><p>You can use Metabase’s <strong>query builder</strong>to filter and summarize data.</p><p>With <a>custom expressions</a>, you can accomplish pretty much anything you’d be able to do with SQL: <a>join tables</a>, create custom columns, filter and group results, <a>compare time series</a>, and more. Plus, people who don’t know SQL can duplicate your question and use it as a starting point for another question.</p><p>Query builder questions automatically get a drill-through menu applied to their visualizations, allowing people to click on a table or chart to <a>drill through the data</a>.</p><p>Questions asked with the query builder can start with a <a>model</a>, a raw table, or with the results of a saved question, and you can convert them to native SQL at any time.</p><h4>Native queries</h4><p>Use the <strong>native query editor</strong>to compose questions in the database’s native query languages (typically SQL for relational databases, but also other query languages for data sources like MongoDB).

And with <a>custom expressions</a>, you can handle the vast majority of analytical use cases, without ever needing to reach for SQL. Questions composed using the <strong>Query Builderr</strong>also benefit from automatic <a>drill-through</a>, which allows viewers of your charts to click through and explore the data, a feature not available to questions written in SQL.</p><h2>Glaring errors or omissions?</h2><p>There are libraries of books on SQL, so we’re only scratching the surface here.
