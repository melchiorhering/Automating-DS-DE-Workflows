Documentation Title:
Setting up Metabase

Documentation Content:
We won‚Äôt be able to connect to your database without it, but you‚Äôd like to deal with all of this later, that‚Äôs okay: just click **I‚Äôll add my data later**. Metabase comes with a Sample Databasethat you can play around with to get a feel for how Metabase works.

If you‚Äôre ready to connect, here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll need:

* The **hostname**of the server where your database lives
* The **port**the database server uses
* The **database name**
* The **username**you use for the database
* The **password**you use for the database

If you don‚Äôt have this information handy, the person responsible for administering the database should have it.

Connect to your database
------------------------

Now that you have your database info you can connect to your database. Sweet, sweet data at last. Just go ahead and put your info into this form and click **Next**.

!For more on connecting to databases, see Adding and managing databases.

Usage data preferences
----------------------

One last quick thing that you‚Äôll have to decide is if it‚Äôs okay for us to collect some anonymous info about how you use the product ‚Äî it helps us make Metabase better. Like the box says:

* Metabase never collects anything about your data or question results.
* All collection is completely anonymous.
* Collection can be turned off at any point in your admin settings.

!If you‚Äôre ready to start using Metabase, go ahead and click **Next**.

Staying in touch
----------------

At this point you are all set and ready to use Metabase. Since we like keeping in touch with our friends we made it easy to sign up for our newsletter (infrequent emails) with a single click!

!Once you‚Äôre done here simply follow the link to **Take me to Metabase**. And if you decided to skip the newsletter sign-up, it‚Äôs cool, we still like you :)

Getting started with Metabase
-----------------------------

For a tutorial on getting up and running with questions and dashboards, head over to Learn Metabase.

Add users to our source Metabase

Let‚Äôs add one Admin account, and two basic users to our metabase-source instance.

You can add users to your Metabase manually(i.e., in the Metabase application), but here‚Äôs a quick bash script that creates an Admin user (the initial user) and two basic users:

You‚Äôll need to have jqinstalled to handle the JSON in this script.

`#!/bin/shADMIN_EMAIL=${MB_ADMIN_EMAIL:-admin@metabase.local}ADMIN_PASSWORD=${MB_ADMIN_PASSWORD:-Metapass123}METABASE_HOST=${MB_HOSTNAME}METABASE_PORT=${MB_PORT:-3000}echo"‚åöÔ∏é Waiting for Metabase to start"while(!curl -s-m5 http://${METABASE_HOST}:${METABASE_PORT}/api/session/properties -o/dev/null);do sleep 5;done

echo"üòé Creating admin user"SETUP_TOKEN=$(curl -s-m5 -XGET \-H"Content-Type: application/json"\http://${METABASE_HOST}:${METABASE_PORT}/api/session/properties \| jq -r'.

Source Metabase

Create the Postgres database:

`docker run --rm-d--namepostgres \-p5433:5432 \-ePOSTGRES_USER=metabase \-ePOSTGRES_PASSWORD=knockknock \--networkmetanet \postgres:12`Create our source Metabase, and connect it to Postgres database we just created:

`docker run --rm-d--namemetabase-source \-p5001:3000 \-eMB_DB_TYPE=postgres \-eMB_DB_DBNAME=metabase \-eMB_DB_PORT=5432 \-eMB_DB_USER=metabase \-eMB_DB_PASS=knockknock \-eMB_DB_HOST=postgres \--networkmetanet \metabase/metabase-enterprise:v1.49.11`You can check the container‚Äôs logs to view the container‚Äôs progress:

`docker logs metabase-source`Once you see the line that contains ‚ÄúMetabase initialization COMPLETE‚Äù, you can open a browser to `http://localhost:5001`to view your Metabase instance.

Documentation Title:
Running the Metabase JAR file

Documentation Content:
Production application database

Here are some databases we support.

For example, say you want to use PostgreSQL. You would get a PostgreSQL service up and running and create an empty database:

`createdb metabaseappdb`You can call your app db whatever you want. And there‚Äôs no need to create any tables in that database; Metabase will do that for you. You‚Äôll just need to set environment variables for Metabase to use on startup so Metabase knows how to connect to this database.

You‚Äôll create a directory for your Metabase like in the steps listed above for the Local installation, but when it‚Äôs time to run the `java -jar`command to start up the JAR, you‚Äôll prefix the command with some environment variables to tell Metabase how to connect to the `metabaseappdb`you created:

`export MB_DB_TYPE=postgres
export MB_DB_DBNAME=metabaseappdb
export MB_DB_PORT=5432
export MB_DB_USER=username
export MB_DB_PASS=password
export MB_DB_HOST=localhost
java -jar metabase.jar`The above command would connect Metabase to your Postgres database, `metabaseappdb`via `localhost:5432`with the user account `username`and password `password`. If you‚Äôre running Metabase as a service, you‚Äôll put these environment variables in a separate configuration file.
