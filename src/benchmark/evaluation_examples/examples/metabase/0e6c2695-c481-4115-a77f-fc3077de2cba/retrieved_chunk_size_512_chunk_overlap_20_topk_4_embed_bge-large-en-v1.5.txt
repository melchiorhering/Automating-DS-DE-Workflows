Next, summarize the count of rows and group by Product -> Category.
Click
Visualize
, and Metabase will present the data as a bar chart:
Bar chart settings
To customize the chart, click on the
gear
icon at the bottom left of the chart to open the settings sidebar, within the settings, you’ll find the following tabs:
Data
Display
Axes
Data
Here we can format and style our bar chart by clicking the
...
under Y-axis.
To change bar colors, click the color swatch and choose from the palette.
Customize your chart in the
Formatting tab
by adjusting numbers, separators, decimals, and scale. You can also add Prefix/Suffix as needed. In the
Style tab
, select colors, modify labels, choose a chart type (line, area, or bar), and position the Y-axis according to your chart preferences.
Display settings
In the Settings > Display section, you can customize your chart in several ways:
Add a goal line
This specifies where you want the values to be. Metabase can
alert
you when the values exceed (or drop below) that goal. For example, you can add a goal line at 5500 and name it ‘Arbitrary Sales Goal’.
Show values
Toggling on ‘Show values’ places the count values above each column.
Add a trend line
When your data is summarized and grouped by a datetime field, you can add a trend lie. The trend line shows the general direction that your data is heading in over time. To add a trend line, simply toggle on the ‘Trend line’ option.
Stacking options
When creating bar or area charts with multiple series, you can choose how the series are displayed with the stacking options. You can choose not to stack the series, stack them, or stack them at 100%.
We can also set the display to a
stacked bar chart
, which we’ll get into in a bit.
Axes
Select
Axes
in the
Settings sidebar
.
Here we can specify how we want our table organized.
Label
Here we can hide or customize axes labels.
Show lines and marks
With the
Show lines and marks
options we can change the way the categories and quantities are represented on each axis.

How to create a line chart
Let’s take a look at the
Orders
table in the
Sample Database
that ships with Metabase. From the main navigation bar, click on
+ New
>
Question
, which will take you to Metabase’s query builder. Choose
Raw Data
>
Sample Database
, then pick the
Orders
table. Click
Visualize
, then click the
Visualization button
in the bottom right to bring up the
Visualization sidebar
.
Let’s start with how
not
to create a line chart. If you select
line chart
, Metabase will present you with an empty line chart.
Metabase can’t read minds (yet), so it doesn’t know which columns from the
Orders
table to use for the x and y axes. To create a line chart, you’ll need to pick a metric for Metabase to plot over time. For example, you could show order totals over time by setting the x axis to
created_at
and the y axis to
total
. Metabase will automatically plot the line chart:
That’s technically a line chart, but it looks more like the cardiograph of a startled hummingbird, and that’s even after Metabase has truncated the results shown. (If you hover over the gray warning triangle in the upper right, you’ll see that Metabase has only plotted 2,000 rows.)
To make the chart more legible, we can summarize the data, so each point on the line chart is an aggregate of rows—“buckets” of records. (It’s much more common to plot unaggregated rows in visualizations like
pin maps
, or a
scatterplot
, e.g., to show each product plotted by price and rating.)
As an example of an aggregated metric, let’s plot the sum of order totals for each month. Click on the green
Summarize button
to pull up the
Summarize sidebar
. Metabase defaults to counting the records, but we’re not interested in the number of orders, so we’ll click on
Count
and change it to
Sum of
and select the
Total
column from
Order
.
Next, we’ll want to group our order totals by month.
