Documentation Title:
Setting up Metabase

Documentation Content:
We won’t be able to connect to your database without it, but you’d like to deal with all of this later, that’s okay: just click
I’ll add my data later
. Metabase comes with a
Sample Database
that you can play around with to get a feel for how Metabase works.
If you’re ready to connect, here’s what you’ll need:
The
hostname
of the server where your database lives
The
port
the database server uses
The
database name
The
username
you use for the database
The
password
you use for the database
If you don’t have this information handy, the person responsible for administering the database should have it.
Connect to your database
Now that you have your database info you can connect to your database. Sweet, sweet data at last. Just go ahead and put your info into this form and click
Next
.
For more on connecting to databases, see
Adding and managing databases
.
Usage data preferences
One last quick thing that you’ll have to decide is if it’s okay for us to collect some anonymous info about how you use the product — it helps us make Metabase better. Like the box says:
Metabase never collects anything about your data or question results.
All collection is completely anonymous.
Collection can be turned off at any point in your admin settings.
If you’re ready to start using Metabase, go ahead and click

.
Staying in touch
At this point you are all set and ready to use Metabase. Since we like keeping in touch with our friends we made it easy to sign up for our newsletter (infrequent emails) with a single click!
Once you’re done here simply follow the link to
Take me to Metabase
. And if you decided to skip the newsletter sign-up, it’s cool, we still like you :)

Documentation Title:
Configuration file

Documentation Content:
The first user listed in the config file may be designated an admin, but not necessarily. If someone has already spun up and logged into that Metabase for the first time, Metabase will make that first user an admin. Additionally, you can specify a user account as an admin by using the
is_superuser: true
key.
In the following example, assuming that the Metabase hasn’t already been set up (which creates the first user) both users
first@example.com
and
admin@example.com
will be admins:
first@example.com
because it’s the first user account on the list, and
admin@example.com
because that user has the
is_superuser
flag set to true.
version: 1
config:
  users:
    - first_name: First
      last_name: Person
      password: metabot1
      email: first@example.com
    - first_name: Normal
      last_name: Person
      password: metabot1
      email: normal@example.com
    - first_name: Admin
      last_name: Person
      password: metabot1
      is_superuser: true
      email: admin@example.com
If the Metabase has already been set up, then
first @example.com
will be loaded as a normal user.
Databases
On a new Metabase, the example below sets up an admin user account and one database connection.
version: 1
config:
  users:
    - first_name: Cam
      last_name: Era
      password: 2cans3cans4cans
      email: cam@example.com
  databases:
    - name: test-data (Postgres)
      engine: postgres
      details:
        host: localhost
        port: 5432
        user: dbuser
        password: "{{ env POSTGRES_TEST_DATA_PASSWORD }}"
        dbname: test-data
To determine which keys you can specify for a database, check out the fields available in Metabase itself for the database that you want to add.
Referring to environment variables in the
config.yml
As shown in the Databases example above, environment variables can be specified with
{{ template-tags }}
like
{{ env POSTGRES_TEST_DATA_PASSWORD }}
or
[[options {{template-tags}}]]
.

Configuring Metabase
Setting up Metabase
This guide will help you set up Metabase once you’ve gotten it installed. If you haven’t installed Metabase yet, you can
get Metabase here
.
Start Metabase up for the first time and you’ll see this screen:
Go ahead and click
Let’s get started
.
Setting up an admin account
The first thing you’ll need to do is set up an admin account. The account you create when you first install Metabase is an admin account by default — handy! If you’ve installed Metabase on a production server, you should be really careful to remember the password for this account since it will be used to add other users, connect to databases, set up email, and more. You can also create additional admin accounts later.
For now, let’s just create an account for ourselves to explore Metabase. Type in your info, and when you’re ready to continue, click the
Next
button.
What will you use Metabase for?
Let us know your plans with Metabase so that we can best guide you.
Self-service analytics for my own company
Embedding analytics into my application
A bit of both
Not sure yet
Don’t worry about picking the wrong option. If you say you’re interested in embedding, Metabase will display a card with a link to the embedding settings when you (the admin) first log in to your instance. Just a little convenience thing, that’s all.
Gathering your database info
At this point you’ll need to gather some information about the database you want to use with Metabase.

Documentation Title:
Serialization: preloading dashboards in a new Metabase instance

Documentation Content:
Target Metabase
Setting up a target Metabase is similar. On our metanet network, we’ll set up a Postgres database to serve as our application database, then spin up another Metabase in another Docker container.
Note the changes to:
ports for both Postgres (5434) and the Metabase server (5002)
Instance names:
postgres-target
and
metabase-target
Application database:
docker run
--rm
-d
--name
postgres-target
\
-p
5434:5432
\
-e
POSTGRES_USER
=
metabase
\
-e
POSTGRES_PASSWORD
=
knockknock
\
--network
metanet postgres:12
Metabase instance:
docker run
--rm
-d
--name
metabase-target
\
-p
5002:3000
\
-e
MB_DB_TYPE
=
postgres
\
-e
MB_DB_DBNAME
=
metabase
\
-e
MB_DB_PORT
=
5432
\
-e
MB_DB_USER
=
metabase
\
-e
MB_DB_PASS
=
knockknock
\
-e
MB_DB_HOST
=
postgres-target
\
--network
metanet
\
metabase/metabase-enterprise:v1.49.11
After our Metabase instances complete their initialization (patience, this could take a minute or two), we should now have two Metabases up and running:
metabase-source at
http://localhost:5001
metabase-target at
http://localhost:5002
Add users to our source Metabase
Let’s add one Admin account, and two basic users to our metabase-source instance.
You can
add users to your Metabase manually
(i.e., in the Metabase application), but here’s a quick bash script that creates an Admin user (the initial user) and two basic users:
You’ll need to have
jq
installed to handle the JSON in this script.
