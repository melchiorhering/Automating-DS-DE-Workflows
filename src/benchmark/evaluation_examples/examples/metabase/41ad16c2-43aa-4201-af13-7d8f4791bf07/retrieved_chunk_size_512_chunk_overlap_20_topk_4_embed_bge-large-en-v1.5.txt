Documentation Title:
Running the Metabase JAR file

Documentation Content:
1. Install Java JRE
You may already have Java installed. To check the version, open a terminal and run:
java -version
If Java isn’t installed, you’ll need to install Java before you can run Metabase. We recommend version 11 of JRE from
Eclipse Temurin
with HotSpot JVM. You can run Metabase wherever Java 11 runs. The particular processor architecture shouldn’t matter (although we only test Metabase for x86 and ARM).
2. Download Metabase
Download the JAR file:
Metabase OSS
Metabase Enterprise/Pro edition
If you want to install the
Pro or Enterprise editions
of Metabase, see
Activating your Metabase commercial license
.
3. Create a new directory and move the Metabase JAR into it
When you run Metabase, Metabase will create some new files, so it’s important to put the Metabase Jar file in a new directory before running it (so move it out of your downloads folder and put it a new directory).
On posix systems, the commands would look something like this:
Assuming you downloaded to
/Users/person/Downloads
:
mkdir ~/metabase
then
mv /Users/person/Downloads/metabase.jar ~/metabase
4. Change into your new Metabase directory and run the jar
Change into the directory you created in step 2:
cd ~/metabase
Now that you have Java working you can run the JAR from a terminal with:
java -jar metabase.jar
Metabase will start using the default settings. You should see some log entries starting to run in your terminal window showing you the application progress as it starts up.

Installation and Operation
Running the Metabase OSS JAR file
To run the free, Open Source version of Metabase via a JAR file, you will need to have a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on your system.
If you have a token for the
Pro or Enterprise editions
of Metabase, see
Activating your Metabase commercial license
.
Quick start
The quick start is intended for running Metabase locally. See below for instructions on
running Metabase in production
.
If you have Java installed:
Download the JAR file for Metabase OSS
. If you’re on a
Pro
or
Enterprise
plan, download the
JAR for the Enterprise Edition
.
Create a new directory and move the Metabase JAR into it.
Change into your new Metabase directory and run the JAR.
java -jar metabase.jar
Metabase will log its progress in the terminal as it starts up. Wait until you see “Metabase Initialization Complete” and visit
http://localhost:3000/setup
.
If you are using a paid version, be sure to
activate your license
.
Local installation
If you just want to try Metabase out, play around with Metabase, or just use Metabase on your local machine, Metabase ships with a default application database that you can use.
This setup is not meant for production
. If you intend to run Metabase for real at your organization, see
Production installation
.
The below instructions are the same as the quick start above, just with a little more context around each step.
1. Install Java JRE
You may already have Java installed.



Documentation Source:
www.metabase.com/docs/v0.49/installation-and-operation/running-the-metabase-jar-file.txt

Documentation Title:
Running the Metabase JAR file

Documentation Content:
Once Metabase is fully started you’ll see a confirmation such as:
...
06-19 10:29:34 INFO metabase.task :: Initializing task CheckForNewVersions
06-19 10:29:34 INFO metabase.task :: Initializing task SendAnonymousUsageStats
06-19 10:29:34 INFO metabase.task :: Initializing task SendAbandomentEmails
06-19 10:29:34 INFO metabase.task :: Initializing task SendPulses
06-19 10:29:34 INFO metabase.task :: Initializing task SendFollowUpEmails
06-19 10:29:34 INFO metabase.task :: Initializing task TaskHistoryCleanup
06-19 10:29:34 INFO metabase.core :: Metabase Initialization COMPLETE
At this point you’re ready to go! You can access your new Metabase server on port 3000, most likely at
http://localhost:3000
.
You can use another port than 3000 by setting the
MB_JETTY_PORT
environment variable
before running the jar.
If you are using a paid version of Metabase, be sure to
activate your license
.
Production installation
The steps are similar to those steps above with two important differences: if you want to run Metabase in production, you’ll want to:
Use a
production application database
to store your Metabase application data.
Run
Metabase as a service
.
If you’d prefer to use Docker, check out
running Metabase on Docker
.
Production application database
Here are some
databases we support
.
For example, say you want to use
PostgreSQL
. You would get a PostgreSQL service up and running and create an empty database:
createdb metabaseappdb
You can call your app db whatever you want. And there’s no need to create any tables in that database; Metabase will do that for you. You’ll just need to set environment variables for Metabase to use on startup so Metabase knows how to connect to this database.
