Working with JSON
With
some databases
, Metabase can unfold JSON columns into their component fields, which you can then filter on using the query builder.
Here is a table with a column that contains JSON.
Metabase can unfold that JSON column so that each key in the JSON object gets its own column in the table. Here are the unfolded fields of the table with the JSON column pictured above:
And here are the values as seen in the table:
This unfolding allows you to filter for values found in the original JSON object.
Metabase will prefix the unfolded column names with the name of the original column that contained the JSON. You can change the column names in
Admin settings
>
Table metadata
, or by creating a
model
and editing the column metadata.
Toggling JSON unfolding for a database
If you notice a hit to performance from this JSON unfolding, we recommend turning it off.
To turn off JSON unfolding for a database:
Click on the
Gear
in the upper right.
Select
Admin settings
Visit the
Databases
tab.
Select the relevant database.
Click
Show advanced options
.
Toggle
Allow unfolding of JSON columns
.
Scroll down and click the
Save changes
button.
Click
Sync database schema now
.
Click
Re-scan field values now
.
Toggling JSON unfolding for a specific column
If performance degrades, or you’d rather keep the JSON contained in the original column, you can turn off unfolding for individual fields in their settings.
Click on the
Gear
in the upper right.
Select
Admin settings
.
Visit the
Table metadata
tab.
Select the database that contains the field you want to update.
Select the table that contains the field.

Documentation Title:
PostgreSQL

Documentation Content:
The command would look something like:
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform DER -in client-key.pem -out client-key.der -nocrypt
Note: if you’re using GCP and you managed to issue client certificates, everything will be given in PEM format, you only need to transform the client-key.pem into a client-key.der for the “SSL Client Key”
Unfold JSON Columns
For PostgreSQL databases, Metabase can unfold JSON columns into component fields to yield a table where each JSON key becomes a column. JSON unfolding is on by default, but you can turn off JSON unfolding if performance is slow.
If you turn on JSON unfolding, you can also toggle the unfolding for individual columns in
table metadata
.
Additional JDBC connection string options
You can append options to the connection string that Metabase uses to connect to your database. Use the format:
options=-c%20key=value
PostgreSQL connection URIs expect
percent-encoding
for whitespaces and symbols.
Re-run queries for simple explorations
Turn this option
OFF
if people want to click
Run
(the play button) before applying any
Summarize
or filter selections.
By default, Metabase will execute a query as soon as you choose an grouping option from the
Summarize
menu or a filter condition from the
drill-through menu
. If your database is slow, you may want to disable re-running to avoid loading data on each click.
Choose when Metabase syncs and scans
Turn this option
ON
to manage the queries that Metabase uses to stay up to date with your database. For more information, see
Syncing and scanning databases
.
Database syncing
If you’ve selected
Choose when syncs and scans happen
>
ON
, you’ll be able to set:
The frequency of the
sync
: hourly (default) or daily.
The time to run the sync, in the timezone of the server where your Metabase app is running.
Scanning for filter values
Metabase can scan the values present in each field in this database to enable checkbox filters in dashboards and questions. This can be a somewhat resource-intensive process, particularly if you have a very large database.

Documentation Title:
Working with JSON

Documentation Content:
Select the database that contains the field you want to update.
Select the table that contains the field.
Select the field containing the original JSON
Scroll to the
Unfold JSON
option and select
Yes
or
No
. If the column was unfolded, Metabase will have hidden this JSON columnn from view, so if you want the JSON column to be visible again, you’ll need to change the column’s visibility to
Everywhere
.
Scroll down and click on the
Re-scan this field
.
For JSON unfolding to work, the column’s data type must be JSON
For example, if you upload a CSV with JSON in it, you might need to update the data/type in the database. Note that you can’t edit the data type via Metabase; you can only change its field type. So even if the field type in Metabase is
Field containing JSON
, if the data/type isn’t
JSON
, Metabase won’t give you the option to unfold the column. You’ll need to change the column type in the database itself.

Documentation Title:
Table metadata admin settings

Documentation Content:
Optional: create a dynamic URL by adding the column name as a
{{parameter}}
.
For example, if you set the
Link URL
for an “Adjective” column to:
https://www.google.com/search?q={{adjective}}
When someone clicks on the value “askew” in the “Adjective” column, they’ll be taken to the Google search URL:
https://www.google.com/search?q=askew
Refresh or discard cached values
To update the values in your filter dropdown menus, refresh or reset the cached values.
Cache actions
include:
Re-scan this table or field
to run a manual scan for new or updated column values. If possible, re-scan the table during off-peak hours, as
scans
can slow down your database.
Discard cached field values
to clear cached values and stop them from showing up in your
filter widgets
.
Table cache actions
Go to
Admin settings
>
Table Metadata
.
Find your database and table.
Click the
gear
icon at the top right (below
Exit admin
).
Select a cache action.
Column cache actions
Go to

Scroll to

Select a cache action.
Unfold JSON
If Metabase supports JSON unfolding for your database, you can decide whether to unfold JSON into component fields, where each JSON key becomes a column. You can turn this off if performance is slow.
Go to
Admin settings
>
Table Metadata
.
Find your database and table.
Click the
gear
icon at the right of a column’s settings box.
Scroll to
Unfold JSON
.
Toggle JSON unfolding.
