`chmod+x create_users.sh`Then run:

`MB_HOSTNAME=localhost MB_PORT=5001 ./create_users.sh`With your metabase-source instance up, and your users created, open up `http://localhost:5001`and sign in as the admin user you created. The user ID is `admin@metabase.local`and the password is `Metapass123`.

You should see a fresh instance of Metabase.

Step 3 - Create dashboards and collections in the source Metabase
-----------------------------------------------------------------

We‚Äôll need some application data to export, so let‚Äôs create some dashboards using the Sample Databaseincluded with Metabase.

www.metabase.com/docs/v0.49/api/setup.md

Documentation Title:
Setup

Documentation Content:
PARAMS:

`token``POST /api/setup/`Special endpoint for creating the first user during setup. This endpoint both creates the user AND logs them in and
 returns a session ID. This endpoint can also be used to add a database, create and invite a second admin, and/or
 set specific settings from the setup flow.

Documentation Title:
Setting up Metabase

Documentation Content:
We won‚Äôt be able to connect to your database without it, but you‚Äôd like to deal with all of this later, that‚Äôs okay: just click **I‚Äôll add my data later**. Metabase comes with a Sample Databasethat you can play around with to get a feel for how Metabase works.

If you‚Äôre ready to connect, here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll need:

* The **hostname**of the server where your database lives
* The **port**the database server uses
* The **database name**
* The **username**you use for the database
* The **password**you use for the database

If you don‚Äôt have this information handy, the person responsible for administering the database should have it.

Connect to your database
------------------------

Now that you have your database info you can connect to your database. Sweet, sweet data at last. Just go ahead and put your info into this form and click **Next**.

!For more on connecting to databases, see Adding and managing databases.

Usage data preferences
----------------------

One last quick thing that you‚Äôll have to decide is if it‚Äôs okay for us to collect some anonymous info about how you use the product ‚Äî it helps us make Metabase better. Like the box says:

* Metabase never collects anything about your data or question results.
* All collection is completely anonymous.
* Collection can be turned off at any point in your admin settings.

!If you‚Äôre ready to start using Metabase, go ahead and click **Next**.

Staying in touch
----------------

At this point you are all set and ready to use Metabase. Since we like keeping in touch with our friends we made it easy to sign up for our newsletter (infrequent emails) with a single click!

!Once you‚Äôre done here simply follow the link to **Take me to Metabase**. And if you decided to skip the newsletter sign-up, it‚Äôs cool, we still like you :)
