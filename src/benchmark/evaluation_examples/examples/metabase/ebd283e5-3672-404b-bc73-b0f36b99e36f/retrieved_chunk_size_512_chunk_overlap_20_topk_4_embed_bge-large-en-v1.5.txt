Documentation Title:
Running Metabase on Docker

Documentation Content:
and we are mounting that folder from our local filesystem into the container.
Getting your config back if you stopped your container
If you’ve previously run and configured your Metabase using the local Database and then stopped the container, your data will still be there unless you deleted the container with the
docker rm
command. To recover your previous configuration:
1. Find the stopped container using the
docker ps -a
command. It will look something like this:
docker ps -a | grep metabase
    ca072cd44a49        metabase/metabase        "/app/run_metabase.sh"   About an hour ago   Up About an hour          0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp   metabase
    02e4dff057d2        262aa3d0f714             "/app/run_metabase.sh"   23 hours ago        Exited (0) 23 hours ago                            pedantic_hypatia
    0d2170d4aa4a        262aa3d0f714             "/app/run_metabase.sh"   23 hours ago        Exited (0) 23 hours ago                            stoic_lumiere
Once you have identified the stopped container with your configuration in it, save the container ID from the left most column for the next step.
2. Use
docker commit
to create a new custom docker image from the stopped container containing your configuration.
docker commit ca072cd44a49 mycompany/metabase-custom
sha256:9ff56186de4dd0b9bb2a37c977c3a4c9358647cde60a16f11f4c05bded1fe77a
3. Run your new image using
docker run
to get up and running again.
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name metabase mycompany/metabase-custom
430bb02a37bb2471176e54ca323d0940c4e0ee210c3ab04262cb6576fe4ded6d
You should have your previously configured Metabase Installation back.

Documentation Title:
Setting up Metabase

Documentation Content:
We won’t be able to connect to your database without it, but you’d like to deal with all of this later, that’s okay: just click
I’ll add my data later
. Metabase comes with a
Sample Database
that you can play around with to get a feel for how Metabase works.
If you’re ready to connect, here’s what you’ll need:
The
hostname
of the server where your database lives
The
port
the database server uses
The
database name
The
username
you use for the database
The
password
you use for the database
If you don’t have this information handy, the person responsible for administering the database should have it.
Connect to your database
Now that you have your database info you can connect to your database. Sweet, sweet data at last. Just go ahead and put your info into this form and click
Next
.
For more on connecting to databases, see
Adding and managing databases
.
Usage data preferences
One last quick thing that you’ll have to decide is if it’s okay for us to collect some anonymous info about how you use the product — it helps us make Metabase better. Like the box says:
Metabase never collects anything about your data or question results.
All collection is completely anonymous.
Collection can be turned off at any point in your admin settings.
If you’re ready to start using Metabase, go ahead and click
Next
.
Staying in touch
At this point you are all set and ready to use Metabase. Since we like keeping in touch with our friends we made it easy to sign up for our newsletter (infrequent emails) with a single click!
Once you’re done here simply follow the link to
Take me to Metabase
. And if you decided to skip the newsletter sign-up, it’s cool, we still like you :)

Documentation Title:
Serialization: preloading dashboards in a new Metabase instance

Documentation Content:
The user ID is
admin@metabase.local
and the password is
Metapass123
.
You should see a fresh instance of Metabase.
Once you log in,
activate your license key
.
Step 3 - Create dashboards and collections in the source Metabase
We’ll need some application data to export, so let’s create some dashboards using the
Sample Database
included with Metabase. Or rather, let’s let Metabase create some dashboards for us!
In the
Try These X-Rays Based On Your Data
section, click on the card with a
yellow lightning bolt
that says something like
A look at Products
. Metabase will generate a set of questions for you that you can save as a dashboard.
Click on the
Save this
button, and Metabase will save the dashboard and its questions in a
collection
titled something like
A look at Products
.
This collection will be saved to a parent collection titled
Automatically Generated Dashboards
. You can find this collection by clicking on the Metabase logo in the upper left of the navigation bar to return to the home screen. From the home page, in the
Our Analytics
section, click on the
Automatically Generated Dashboards
section. From there you should see the collection
A look at your Products table
.
Next, create a new collection. You can call it whatever you like; we’ll use the exciting name
Default collection
, and save it to the
Our Analytics
collection.
Then we’ll move the
A look at Products
collection to our newly created
Default collection
. On the
A look at Products
collection page, click on the ellipses
…
and select
Move
.
Step 4 - Export from source Metabase
Here’s where we actually start using Metabase’s
serialization
feature.
With our
metabase-source
instance set up with some questions, now it’s time to export this data and import it into our
metabase-target
. That way we don’t have to manually recreate our Default Collection in the target Metabase.
