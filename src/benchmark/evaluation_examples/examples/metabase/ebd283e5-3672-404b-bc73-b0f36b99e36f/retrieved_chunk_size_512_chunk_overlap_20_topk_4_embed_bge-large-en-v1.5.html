Documentation Title:
Setting up Metabase

Documentation Content:
Metabase comes with a <a>Sample Database</a>that you can play around with to get a feel for how Metabase works.</p><p>If you’re ready to connect, here’s what you’ll need:</p><ul><li>The <strong>hostname</strong>of the server where your database lives</li><li>The <strong>port</strong>the database server uses</li><li>The <strong>database name</strong></li><li>The <strong>username</strong>you use for the database</li><li>The <strong>password</strong>you use for the database</li></ul><p>If you don’t have this information handy, the person responsible for administering the database should have it.</p><h2>Connect to your database</h2><p>Now that you have your database info you can connect to your database. Sweet, sweet data at last. Just go ahead and put your info into this form and click <strong>Next</strong>.</p><p>For more on connecting to databases, see <a>Adding and managing databases</a>.</p><h2>Usage data preferences</h2><p>One last quick thing that you’ll have to decide is if it’s okay for us to collect some anonymous info about how you use the product — it helps us make Metabase better. Like the box says:</p><ul><li>Metabase never collects anything about your data or question results.</li><li>All collection is completely anonymous.</li><li>Collection can be turned off at any point in your admin settings.</li></ul><p>If you’re ready to start using Metabase, go ahead and click <strong>Next</strong>.</p><h2>Staying in touch</h2><p>At this point you are all set and ready to use Metabase. Since we like keeping in touch with our friends we made it easy to sign up for our newsletter (infrequent emails) with a single click!</p><p>Once you’re done here simply follow the link to <strong>Take me to Metabase</strong>.

Documentation Title:
Backing up Metabase

Documentation Content:
so all you need to do is back up that database and you’re good to go. You can use that backup to restore your Metabase installation if anything goes wrong (like during an upgrade).</p><h2>Backing up the default H2 database</h2><p>If you didn’t specify an application database using environment variables when you launched Metabase, Metabase will have created an embedded H2 database in its directory.</p><p>But if you’re at the point where you have questions and dashboards that you want to keep, you should consider migrating to a <a>production-ready database</a>before you upgrade.</p><p>If you’re just using Metabase for personal use and want to keep your application data, here’s what you’ll need to do.</p><h3>If you’re running the Metabase JAR</h3><ol><li>Navigate to your Metabase directory.</li><li>If your Metabase is running, stop the Metabase process. You can either close the terminal or kill the process with CTRL-C. If you are running the process as a service, then stop the service.</li><li>Copy the application database file (called <code>metabase.db.mv.db</code>) and keep that copy somewhere safe. That’s it.</li><li>Restart Metabase: <code>java -jar metabase.jar</code>or start the service again.</li></ol><h3>If you’re running the Metabase Docker image</h3><p>If you’re running Docker, you should already have switched to a <a>production-ready database</a>.</p><p>Before migrating to a production application database, you should copy the H2 app db file out of the Docker container. For example, if the container is called metabase, you’d run:</p><code>docker cp metabase:/metabase.db/metabase.db.mv.db ./
</code><p>The above command would copy the database file to the directory you ran the command from. You can also create a copy of this H2 file and use it to migrate the data to a production-ready database.
