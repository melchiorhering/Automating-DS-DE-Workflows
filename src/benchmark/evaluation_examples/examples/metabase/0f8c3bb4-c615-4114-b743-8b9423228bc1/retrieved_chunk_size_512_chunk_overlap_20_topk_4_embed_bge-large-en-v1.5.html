Documentation Title:
Managing people and groups

Documentation Content:
These are special groups that can’t be removed.</p><h4>Administrators</h4><p>To make someone an admin of Metabase, you just need to add them to the Administrators group. Metabase admins can log into the Admin Panel and make changes there, and they always have unrestricted access to all data that you have in your Metabase instance. So be careful who you add to the Administrator group!</p><h4>All users</h4><p>The <strong>All Users</strong>group is another special one. Every Metabase user is always a member of this group, though they can also be a member of as many other groups as you want. We recommend using the All Users group as a way to set default access levels for new Metabase users. If you have <a>Google single sign-on</a>enabled, new users who join that way will be automatically added to the All Users group.</p><p>It’s important that your All Users group should never have <em>greater</em>access for an item than a group for which you’re trying to restrict access — otherwise the more permissive setting will win out. See <a>Setting permissions</a>.</p><h2>Creating a group</h2><p>Go to <strong>Admin settings</strong>&gt; <strong>People</strong>&gt; <strong>Groups</strong>, and click the <strong>Add a group</strong>button.</p><p>We recommend creating groups that correspond to the teams your company or organization has, such as Human Resources, Engineering, Finance, and so on.

Interactive embedding quick start

Add a group that corresponds with a group in your app. If you’re using the sample app, add a group called <code>Customer Acme</code>.</p><h3>Synchronize groups between Metabase and your app</h3><p>You’ll map this string in the <code>groups</code>key to a Metabase group, so that when the person signs in via SSO, Metabase automatically assigns them to the appropriate Metabase group.</p><p>In Metabase’s admin section, go to <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>Authentication</strong>. Scroll to the <strong>JWT</strong>card and click <strong>Edit</strong>.</p><p>In the <strong>Group schema</strong>section, toggle on <strong>Synchronize group memberships</strong>. For each group you want to sync, add a group mapping. When you click <strong>New mapping</strong>, enter “Customer-Acme”, the string that you included in the <code>groups</code>array in your JWT payload. You can then associate that group name with the Metabase group “Customer Acme” that we created earlier.</p><p>Be sure to <strong>Save changes</strong>.</p><h3>CHECKPOINT: verify that Metabase assigns people to groups when they log in</h3><p>First, sign out of Metabase and sign in using SSO.</p><p>Then sign out and sign in to your Metabase as an admin and go to <strong>Admin settings</strong>&gt; <strong>People</strong>section and verify that Metabase added the person to the appropriate group.</p><p>Note: only Metabase admins and group managers are aware of groups. Basic users have no concept of groups, and no way of knowing which groups they’re a part of.</p><h2>Set permissions</h2><p>Now to apply permissions to that group so that people only see data specific to their accounts.</p><h3>Reset permissions for the All Users group</h3><p>Metabase ships with two initial groups: “Admins” and “All Users”.
