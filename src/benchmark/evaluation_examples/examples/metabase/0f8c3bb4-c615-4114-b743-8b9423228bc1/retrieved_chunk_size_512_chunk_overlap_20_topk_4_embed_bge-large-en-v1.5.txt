People and Groups
Managing people and groups
To start managing people, click on the
gear
icon >
Admin settings
>
People
. You’ll see a list of all the people in your organization.
Creating an account
To add a new person, click
Invite someone
in the upper right corner. You’ll be prompted to enter their email, and optionally their first and last names–only the email is required.
Click
Create
to activate an account. An account becomes active once you click
Create
, even if the person never signs into the account. The account remains active until you
deactivate the account
. If you’re on a paid Metabase plan, all active accounts will count toward your user account total. If one person has more than one account, each account will count toward the total (see
how billing works
).
If you’ve already
configured Metabase to use email
, Metabase will send the person an email inviting them to log into Metabase. If you haven’t yet setup email for your Metabase, Metabase will give you a temporary password that you’ll have to manually send to the person.
Editing an account
You can edit someone’s name and email address by clicking the three dots icon and choosing
Edit user
.
Be careful: changing an account’s email address
will change the address the person will use to log in to Metabase
.
Adding a user attribute
User attributes is only available on
Pro
and
Enterprise
plans (both self-hosted and on Metabase Cloud).
To add a user attribute manually:
Go to
Admin settings
>
People
.
Find the person’s account and click the
three dot
(…) menu.
Click
Edit user
.
Click
+ Add an attribute
.

Documentation Title:
Managing people and groups

Documentation Content:
These are special groups that can’t be removed.
Administrators
To make someone an admin of Metabase, you just need to add them to the Administrators group. Metabase admins can log into the Admin Panel and make changes there, and they always have unrestricted access to all data that you have in your Metabase instance. So be careful who you add to the Administrator group!
All users
The
All Users
group is another special one. Every Metabase user is always a member of this group, though they can also be a member of as many other groups as you want. We recommend using the All Users group as a way to set default access levels for new Metabase users. If you have
Google single sign-on
enabled, new users who join that way will be automatically added to the All Users group.
It’s important that your All Users group should never have
greater
access for an item than a group for which you’re trying to restrict access — otherwise the more permissive setting will win out. See
Setting permissions
.
Creating a group
Go to
Admin settings
>
People
>
Groups
, and click the
Add a group
button.
We recommend creating groups that correspond to the teams your company or organization has, such as Human Resources, Engineering, Finance, and so on. By default, newly created groups don’t have access to anything.
To remove a group, click the X icon to the right of a group in the list to remove it (remember, you can’t remove the special default groups).
Adding people to groups
To add people to that group, click into a group and then click
Add members
.
To remove someone from that group, click on the
X
to the right of the group member.
You can also add or remove people from groups from the
People
list using the dropdown in the
Groups
column.
Group managers
Group managers is only available on
Pro
and
Enterprise
plans (both self-hosted and on Metabase Cloud).
Group managers
can manage other people within their group.
Group managers can:
Add or remove people from their group (that is, people who already have accounts in your Metabase).
View all people in the
Admin settings
>
People
tab.

Managing people and groups

Documentation Content:
View all people in the
Admin settings
>
People
tab.
Promote other people to group manager, or demote them from group manager to member.
Rename their group.
Group managers are not admins, so their powers are limited. They cannot create new groups or invite new people to your Metabase.
Promoting/demoting group managers
To promote someone to become a group manager:
At the top right of the screen, click the
gear
icon >
Admin settings
>
People
>
Groups
.
Select the group you want the person to manage. If the person isn’t already in the group, you’ll need to add that person to the group.
Find the person you want to promote, hover over their member type, and click the up arrow to promote them to group manager. If you want to demote them, click on the down arrow.

Interactive embedding quick start

Documentation Content:
Then sign out and sign in to your Metabase as an admin and go to
Admin settings
>
People
section and verify that Metabase added the person to the appropriate group.
Note: only Metabase admins and group managers are aware of groups. Basic users have no concept of groups, and no way of knowing which groups they’re a part of.
Set permissions
Now to apply permissions to that group so that people only see data specific to their accounts.
Reset permissions for the All Users group
Metabase ships with two initial groups: “Admins” and “All Users”. By default, Metabase gives the “All Users” group access to connected data sources. And since Metabase grants people the privileges of their most permissive group, you’ll want to restrict what the “All Users” groups can see before you add them to groups with limited or no access to data sources and collections.
To reset permissions for the All users group, click on the
gear
icon and go to
Admin settings
>
Permissions
. Under the
Data
tab, go to
Groups
and select
All Users
. For the
Sample Database
in the
Data access
column, select
No self-service
. Click
Save changes
and a modal will pop up summarizing what you’re changing. Click
Yes
.
Allow view access to the automatically generated dashboards collection
Still in the
Permissions
tab, click on the
Collections
sub-tab, then on the
Automatically generated dashboards
collection, and set the
Collection access
permissions for the
All Users
group to
View
.
Click
Save changes
, then
Yes
.
Add a user attribute to the token
You can include user attributes in the JSON web token. Metabase will pick up any keys from the JWT payload and store them as user attributes. Among other use cases, you can use these user attributes to set row-level permissions on tables, so people can only see results tied to their accounts.
If you’re using our sample app, edit the
signUserToken
function used to create the JWT by adding a key
account_id
with value
28
.
const
signUserToken
=
user
=>
jwt
.
