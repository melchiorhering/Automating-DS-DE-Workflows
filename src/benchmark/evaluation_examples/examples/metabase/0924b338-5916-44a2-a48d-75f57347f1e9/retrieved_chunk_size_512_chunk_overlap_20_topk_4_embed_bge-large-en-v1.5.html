These cards can be:</p><ul><li>Questions, such as <a>tables, charts, or maps</a></li><a>Text and header cards</a><a>Link cards</a></ul><p>You can add <a>filter widgets to dashboards</a>that filter data identically across multiple questions, and <a>customize what happens when people click on a chart or a table</a>.</p><p>You can make as many dashboards as you want. Go nuts.</p><h2>How to create a dashboard</h2><p>In the top right of the screen, click the <strong>+ New</strong>&gt; <strong>Dashboard</strong>.

Click on the <strong>pencil</strong>icon to enter Dashboard edit mode, then:</p><ul><li>Click on the <strong>filter icon</strong>to add a filter widget to the dashboard.</li><li>Under <code>What do we want to filter</code>, we’ll select <code>Time</code>.</li><li>For <code>What kind of filter?</code>, we’ll select <code>Date filter</code>.</li><li>Next, we’ll need to connect our widget to the Field Filter variable in our question. Click on the dropdown menu in the center of our question, and select our <code>Created At</code>Field Filter variable.</li><li>Click the <strong>Done</strong>button at the top of the screen.</li><li>Then <strong>Save</strong>the dashboard.</li></ul><p>Now we’re all wired up, and we’re ready to test out our new Date filter. This particular widget type gives us an abundance of options.

Or rather, let’s let Metabase create some dashboards for us!</p><p>In the <code>Try These X-Rays Based On Your Data</code>section, click on the card with a <strong>yellow lightning bolt</strong>that says something like <code>A look at Products</code>. Metabase will generate a set of questions for you that you can save as a dashboard.</p><p>Click on the <strong>Save this</strong>button, and Metabase will save the dashboard and its questions in a <a>collection</a>titled something like <code>A look at Products</code>.</p><p>This collection will be saved to a parent collection titled <code>Automatically Generated Dashboards</code>. You can find this collection by clicking on the Metabase logo in the upper left of the navigation bar to return to the home screen. From the home page, in the <strong>Our Analytics</strong>section, click on the <code>Automatically Generated Dashboards</code>section. From there you should see the collection <code>A look at your Products table</code>.</p><p>Next, create a new collection. You can call it whatever you like; we’ll use the exciting name <code>Default collection</code>, and save it to the <strong>Our Analytics</strong>collection.</p><p>Then we’ll move the <code>A look at Products</code>collection to our newly created <code>Default collection</code>.

Sharing your work with others

and set up an alert to get notified when your question returns something interesting.</h3></header><ul><a>Saving questions</a><a>Creating a dashboard</a><a>Sharing answers directly</a><a>Set up an alert for your question</a></ul><p>You can use Metabase all on your own, but it becomes even more useful when you start sharing your answers with other people on your team or in your organization. The first step is saving some of your questions.</p><h2>Saving questions</h2><p>Sometimes you’ll find yourself asking certain questions again and again, whether it’s running regular reports, looking up something about an important segment of users, or just answering the same question for other people in your company. To keep from repeating the same set of steps each time you want to ask the same question, you can save your questions to use later.</p><p>To do this, click on the <strong>Save</strong>button in the top-right of the query builder.</p><p>Metabase will take a stab at giving your question a meaningful name, but you can (and should) use your own naming convention that’ll help you and others find your questions later on. You can also pick which <a>collection</a>to save your question in. You can think of collections like folders, to which you can add <a>permissions</a>.</p><p>Save the question you created as “Orders over $40 grouped by month”. When you save a question, Metabase asks if you want to add the question to a new or existing dashboard. Let’s say “yes” and then click on <strong>Create new dashboard</strong>. The dialog prompts you to create a new dashboard and give it a name and description. You can name it anything you want—we’ll call ours <code>My First Dashboard</code>.</p><h2>Creating a dashboard</h2><p>Dashboards are great when you have a set of answers that you want to view together.
