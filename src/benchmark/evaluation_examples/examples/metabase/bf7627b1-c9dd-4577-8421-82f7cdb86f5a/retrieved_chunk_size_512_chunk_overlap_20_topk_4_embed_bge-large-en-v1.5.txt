Documentation Title:
Exploring data with Metabase's data browser

Documentation Content:
The Databases page
The
Databases
page in the
Admin Panel
displays connection information about your databases:
The database type
How Metabase is connected to your Metabase instance
Sync settings
Metabase does a lightweight sync every hour to keep your in-app data current, but you can use this page to manually
sync your database
, manage sync frequency, and with some databases, determine which schemas to sync.
Editing metadata in Table Metadata
Picking clear names and adding descriptions will help people find the data they’re looking for, and provide important context for analysis. Metabase can automatically try to create human-readable names of your tables and columns for you, but if Metabase misses the mark, you can always disable the
Friendly Table and Field Names
feature.
Admins can make changes to your metadata in Metabase, by clicking on the
gear
icon in the upper right and going to
Admin settings
>
Table metadata
. The Table metadata tab displays options to
edit metadata
for the database, tables, and columns. For example, you can edit a column’s name, visibility, type, and description. You can also
remap foreign keys
to give human readable names to foreign key columns!
Some tips for making life easier for people:
When column names are confusing, you can
change their names
or
add a description
.
You can
hide
unused columns to make tables easier to digest.
You can pick your preferred
filter interface
from three options (search box, list of values, or plain input box).
Perhaps the
most important
piece of metadata you can change is the
field type
. There is a long list of
field types
to choose from. Selecting the correct type for a column can connect information across multiple tables, and give context to Metabase so it can choose visualizations appropriate for your data. For example, once you’ve accurately identified latitude and longitude columns in your table, you will be able to use
map visualizations
.

Deleting models and tables created by uploads
Models
You can archive a model by clicking on the three dots in the upper right and selecting
Archive
.
For deleting models completely, see
Deleting items permanently
.
Tables
You’ll need to drop that table in the database itself (not in Metabase). For how to delete tables, see your database’s documentation.
Note on uploading data to a MySQL database
For speeding up uploads to a MySQL database, we recommend that you set a
local_infile
to
ON
. You’ll need to set this
local_infile
in MySQL, not Metabase. The command-line format is
--local-infile=ON
.
If
local_infile
is disabled (set to
OFF
), Metabase will automatically fall back to uploading CSVs in a much slower way.
For more context, check out:
Non-LOCAL Versus LOCAL Operation
Reference docs for the local_infile variable
Security Considerations for LOAD LOCAL DATA

versions of Metabase
