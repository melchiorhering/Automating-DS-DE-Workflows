Questions
Pivot table
Pivot tables allow you swap rows and columns, group data, and include subtotals in your table. You can group one or more metrics by one or more dimensions.
Pivot tables are not currently available for the following databases in Metabase:
Druid
Google Analytics
MongoDB
Pivot tables work for simple and custom questions with summarized data for all other
officially supported databases
. They don’t work for questions that lack aggregate data, and they don’t work for questions written in SQL, as Metabase would need to modify your SQL code in order to calculate subtotals. If you really need to use SQL, the workaround here is to create your question in two steps: first do all the complex things you need to do in SQL, save the results as a question, then use that saved SQL question as the starting point for a new GUI question which summarizes that data.
In the settings for the Pivot Table visualization, you can assign fields to one of three “buckets”:
Fields to use for the table
rows
Fields to use for the table
columns
Fields to use for the table
values
Let’s say we ask the following question in the notebook editor:
From the
Orders
table, we’ve summarized by the count of orders and the average order total, and grouped by
User → State
,
Product → Category
, and
Created At
binned by year. Here’s our question visualized as a pivot table:
We’ve assigned the fields
User → State
and
Created At
to table rows, and assigned the
Product -> Category
field to generate our columns: Doohickey, Gadget, and so on. We can drag and drop dimensions between the row and column buckets, and add aggregations to the table values bucket.

Creating pivot tables

regular tables
Your typical, basic table is a grid of cells. Each column represents an attribute of a single record, with a single record per row.
A pivot table is a table that groups rows and columns, and includes summary rows with aggregate values for those groupings. These aggregate values are usually referred to as subtotals and grand totals, though these aggregates could also be other values, such as averages.
The reason they’re called pivot tables is because you can rotate (“pivot”) a column 90 degrees so that the values in that column become column headings themselves. Pivoting values into column headings can be really helpful when trying to analyze data across multiple attributes, like time, location, and category. You can pivot multiple rows to columns and vice versa, or not pivot any at all.
But this is all pretty abstract, so let’s walk you through an example to give you a feel for how pivot tables work.
How to create pivot tables: example
To start, let’s say we want to know:
How much annual revenue orders are bringing in
For each state (i.e., where do our customers live?)
and how those orders break down by product category
Here’s our query using the
Query Builder
:
Here we’re taking data from the
Orders
table and summarizing the records. We’re grouping the orders by
User → State
,
Created At
(by year), and
Product → Category
. For each group (say Alaska in 2017), we count the number of orders and add up the subtotals for those orders. (Note that, even though we’ve only selected the
Orders
table in the data section, Metabase will automatically join the
Products
and
People
tables to get the State and Category data.)
The resulting table is a regular one, with rows for each combination of state, year, and product category.
Now, let’s say that for each state, we also want to know the sum of the annual subtotals for each state (e.g., how much money did orders for Doohickey products make in Alaska for all years?). To find out, we could add up the subtotals ourselves, or use a pivot table to calculate that figure for us. At the bottom left of your screen, click

How to create pivot tables: limitations
Pivot tables only work with relational databases that support joins and expressions, so you won’t be able to use them with databases like MongoDB. They also only work with questions composed with the query builder. The workaround here is that if you must use SQL to compose a question, you can save that question, then use its
results as the starting point
for a query builder question in order to build a question. The trick here is to do your aggregation and grouping in the GUI question. That is, use the SQL question to grab the raw data you want to work with (maybe
create a model
), then start a new GUI question to filter, summarize, and group that data.
For example, to use a SQL question to build the pivot table we created above, you’d first write a SQL query to get the raw data you want to work with:
SELECT
people
.
state
,
products
.
category
,
orders
.
subtotal
,
orders
.
created_at
FROM
orders
INNER
JOIN
products
ON
orders
.
product_id
=
products
.
id
INNER
JOIN
people
ON
orders
.
user_id
=
people
.
id
Notice that we’re just grabbing records here; there’s no summarizing or grouping. Next, we save that SQL question (here as
Raw data for pivot table
), and start a new query builder question that uses the results of that question as its starting data.
Now we can count, sum, and group our results:
When we visualize this question, we’ll now be able to use the pivot table visualization to see the group subtotals and grand totals.

Pivot table
.
In our pivot table, Metabase has set the rows, columns, and values as follows:
rows:
User → State
and
Created At
(by year)
columns:
Product → Category
values:
Count
and
Sum of Subtotal
Like the flat table, the pivot table lets us see, for example, that in 2020 our customers in Alaska (AK) have purchased a combined 11 Doohickey products for $867.63. But now the pivot table has grouped the rows related to Alaska, and given a subtotal for those Alaskan rows, allowing us to see the answer to our question: Alaskans purchased 103 Doohickeys from 2016–2020, totaling $6,900.43.
In addition to the group subtotals, the pivot table also includes both row and column grand totals:
Row grand total example: the total number of Doohickey orders placed across all states.
Column grand total example: the sum of all subtotals in Alaska across all product categories.
We can navigate the table by collapsing and expanding groups of rows:
Now, let’s try pivoting the table. In the bottom left of the screen, we’ll click on
Settings
. To pivot the table, we’ll move fields between the three buckets: rows, columns, and values.
Order
within
a single bucket matters, so let’s start by simply rearranging the table within a single bucket: the rows bucket. If we switch the order of fields to use for table rows, putting
Created At
above
User → State
, the table will rearrange itself:
Now the table groups first by year, then gives a breakdown of orders for each state across each product category.
We can also switch fields
between
the buckets, like moving
Product → Category
from a column to a row, and
User → State
from a row to a column.
You can also turn off subtotals for a given row grouping:
Like with flat tables, we have some sorting and formatting options, and we can click on values in the table to bring up the drill-through menu, which will lets us
drill through the data
.
