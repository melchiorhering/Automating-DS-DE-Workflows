Questions
Maps
When you select the
Map
visualization setting, Metabase will automatically try and pick the best kind of map to use based on the table or result set. Here are the maps that Metabase uses:
Region maps
There are two region maps included with Metabase:
World Map
To visualize your results in the format of a map of the world broken out by country, your result must contain a column with two-letter
country codes
.
United States Map
Creating a map of the United States from your data requires your results to contain a column that contains names of states or two-letter state codes. This lets you do things like visualize the count of your users broken out by state, with darker states representing more users.
Pin map
If your results contains
latitude and longitude fields
, Metabase will try to display the results as a pin map of the world. Metabase will put one pin on the map for each row in your table, based on the latitude and longitude fields. You can try this with the Sample Database that’s included in Metabase: start a new question and select the People table, use
raw data
for your view, and choose the Map option for your visualization. You’ll see a map of the world, with each dot representing the latitude and longitude coordinates of a single person from the People table.
When you open up the Map options, you can manually switch between a region map (e.g., United States) and a pin map. If you’re using a region map, you can also choose which field to use as the measurement, and which field to use as the region (e.g., State or Country).
Custom maps
Metabase also allows administrators to add
custom maps via GeoJSON files
through the Metabase
Admin Panel
.

Metabase wouldn’t automatically know what kind of data type the
state
or
total
or any other column was. If, however, we manually set the type for each result column in the model’s metadata, Metabase will then be able to present the drill-through menu on charts, as well as know which kind of filters it should use for that column (e.g., filters for numbers will have different options than for dates or categories).
Models can surface individual records in search
Another neat metadata feature with models: you can opt to
index values from a model
so that they show up in Metabase’s search results.
Here we’re toggling on the option to
Surface individual records in search by matching against this column
(bottom right):
For example, you could index a column in a model with customer names so people can type in a customer like Hudson Borer and jump straight to the detail view for that customer.
By indexing records in a model, you can also X-ray them. See the
docs on models for more details
.
Skip the SQL variables
Here is a subtle point worth calling out. If you’re used to creating “models” with saved questions and SQL variables (like
field filters
) so that people can take those questions and connect them to dashboard filters, models take a different approach here. Models don’t work with variables, because they don’t need to. Once you tell Metabase the model’s column types, you can start a question from that model, save it, and be able to wire it up to a dashboard filter. There’s no need to put a variable in your SQL code.

Documentation Title:
Visualizing data with maps

Documentation Content:
Region maps
group data by country or state.
Grid maps
distribute a large number of points over a specified area.
Any of these map types can be used with our two default map options: the United States and the world. For a different map (for example, one that focuses on a specific region of the world), you can upload a
custom map
in GeoJSON format.
If you have a column with two-letter country codes, Metabase will automatically select the world map. If your data contains names of U.S. states, or two-letter state codes, Metabase will select the map of the United States.
Make your data compatible with mapping
If you plan on using a map visualization, you’ll need to make sure your data is compatible with map visualizations in two ways:
Field types in your metadata
Field types
Country codes
To edit metadata, go to your
Data Model admin settings
. Confirm that all your field types are set as a
Location
data type. For example, the
State
and
Longitude
fields both have their corresponding field type listed, but
Latitude
has no field type. To add the field type, click the dropdown menu in the
Type
column and select
Latitude
.
To create a world map or US region map, make sure that your country or state codes match the standardized two-letter format specified by the
International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
.
Matches are case-sensitive; if the country or state codes listed in your database are lowercase or contain extra spaces, Metabase won’t recognize them.
Pin map
A pin map represents data geographically using discrete markers, and requires coordinates — latitude and longitude — to generate. Let’s start an example by visualizing the
People
table found within the
Sample Database
. Once you’re viewing the table, you’ll notice that this table contains four pieces of geographic information: city, state, latitude, and longitude.
Select
Visualization
, and scroll to the
Map
icon. With your latitude and longitude fields
set correctly
, Metabase will produce a pin map by default, placing markers on the map at those coordinates. The pins are locating customers, but you can also use a pin map to locate businesses partners, company branch locations, or shipping addresses, as long as those records contains coordinates.

Documentation Title:
Visualizing data with maps

Documentation Content:
Hovering over a pin provides additional information.
Other cool things you can do with pin maps:
Double click to zoom in on an area.
Click and drag the map to move to a different area.
Click on a pin to
drill-through
to additional information.
If your pin is linked to other tables, or there’s too much information to fit in the tooltip, clicking on the point will take you to a details page that displays a list of fields, as well as a list of connected tables. Clicking a relationship to another table directs you to a list of the instances where the current pin and the other table intersect. In this case, Metabase displays orders placed by that person.
Region map
Region maps display data across a geographic area by coloring parts of that area according to a value. Grouping people by region can be a great way to detect patterns in your customer base. Let’s generate a region map using the same
People
table within the
Sample Database
. Summarize the data by selecting the green
Summarize
button at the top righthand corner of your screen. If you count the number of records by
State
, Metabase will produce a region map, displaying a map of the United States, with the varying shades representing how many records are present for each state.
Here’s a
drill-through
on Texas to see how user creation has been tracking.
Region maps require your data to have columns with the (
correctly formatted
) field type
State
or
Country
.
Like the
pin map
, you can
drill through
states, but the interface and options are slightly different. With regional maps, you have data points that have been grouped together by state or country, so drilling through will reveal an
action-menu
instead of additional details about a single data.
Grid map
Grid maps create a colorful gradient that overlays the map. Grid maps are an excellent way to visualize answers to questions about where most of your customers come from, or where your company is experiencing the most activity. They are also a great alternative to
pin maps
for huge quantities of data displayed across a single map.
To create a grid map, you need to bin latitude and longitude.

Browse Data
from the button at the top of the screen.
