Copy
The result shows two data errors in
mycsvtable/contacts3.csv.gz
:
Number
of
columns
in
file
(11)
does
not
match
that
of
the
corresponding
table
(10)
In Row 1, a hyphen was mistakenly replaced with the pipe (
|
) character, the data file delimiter, effectively creating an additional column in the record.
Field
delimiter
'|'
found
while
expecting
record
delimiter
'n'
In Row 5, an additional pipe (
|
) character was introduced after a hyphen, breaking the record.
Fix the errors and load the data files again
¶
In regular use, you would fix the problematic records manually and write them to a new data file.
You would then stage the fixed data files to the S3 bucket and attempt to reload the data from
the files. For this tutorial, you are using Snowflake provided sample data, which you do not correct.
Verify the loaded data
¶
Execute a
SELECT
statement to verify that the data was loaded successfully.
