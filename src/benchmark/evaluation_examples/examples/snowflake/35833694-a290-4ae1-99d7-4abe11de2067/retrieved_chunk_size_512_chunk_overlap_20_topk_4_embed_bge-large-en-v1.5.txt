Visualize query results with charts and dashboards
¶
When you run a query in Snowsight, you can choose to view your results as a chart. You can also create a collection of charts
as a
Dashboard
, allowing you to review your data more easily. Dashboards provide flexible collections of charts arranged as tiles.
Dashboard charts start with SQL to generate results and associated charts. You can share these charts with others, modify the charts,
and display them as dashboard tiles.
To learn more about charts, see
Visualizing worksheet data
. To learn more about dashboards,
see
Visualizing data with dashboards
Explore and manage your database objects
¶
You can explore and manage your database objects in Snowsight as follows:
Explore databases and objects, including tables, functions, views, and more using the database object explorer.
Create objects like databases, tables, file formats, and more.
Search within the object explorer to browse database objects across your account.
Preview the contents of database objects like tables, and view the files uploaded to a stage.
Load files to an existing table, or create a table from a file so that you can start working with data in Snowflake faster.

Share and publish data products
¶
Collaborate with users in other Snowflake accounts by sharing data and application packages with them, or publishing those data products
on the Snowflake Marketplace. When you share or publish data products with a listing, you can use auto-fulfillment to easily provide your data
products in other Snowflake regions.
As a consumer of data, you can access datasets and application packages shared with your account or published on the Snowflake Marketplace,
helping you derive real time data insights without needing to set up a data pipeline or write any code.

¶
To add an existing worksheet as a tile, complete the following steps:
Open a worksheet
.
On the worksheet tab, select
, and then select
Move to
.
Select an existing dashboard.
The worksheet is added to the dashboard and removed from the list of worksheets. A tile showing a chart for the worksheet
displays on the dashboard.
Rearrange the order of tiles
¶
By default, tiles are added to the bottom of the dashboard.
To rearrange the tiles on a dashboard, drag a tile to a new position. As you drag the tile, a preview of the new position appears.
Edit charts
¶
To edit a chart that appears in a tile, complete the following steps:
From the tile menu (
), select
View Chart
.
The chart opens in a worksheet.
Make changes to the chart. To learn more about charts, see
Visualizing worksheet data
.
When you are finished editing the chart, select
Return to <dashboard name>
to save your changes and return to the dashboard.

Visualizing data with dashboards
Visualizing data with dashboards
¶
You can use dashboards to visualize and communicate query results using charts in
Snowsight
.
Dashboards are flexible collections of charts arranged as tiles. The charts are generated by query results and can be customized.
You can also create dashboard tiles from charts in worksheets. For more details, see
Visualizing worksheet data
.
Create a dashboard
¶
You can create an empty dashboard or create a dashboard directly from a worksheet.
Create an empty dashboard
¶
To create an empty dashboard, complete the following steps:
Sign in to Snowsight.
In the navigation menu, select
Projects
»
Dashboards
.
Select
+ Dashboard
.
Enter a name for the dashboard, and then select
Create Dashboard
.
The empty dashboard opens.

Note
If you run this example yourself, your output will not match exactly because the
sensor_data_ts
table is loaded
with randomly generated values.
You can use Snowsight to visualize the results of queries like this one, and get a
better sense of the smoothing effect of calculations with sliding window frames.
In the query worksheet, click the
Chart
button next to
Results
.
For example, the yellow line in the bar chart shows a much smoother trend for average
temperature versus the blue line for the raw temperature.
Other window functions, such as the
LEAD
and
LAG
ranking functions,
are also commonly used in time-series analysis. Use the LEAD window function to find the next data point in the time series,
relative to the current data point, and the LAG function to find the previous data point.
