API</a><a>Python</a><span>Writing Snowpark Code in Python Worksheets</span></nav><section><h1>Writing Snowpark Code in Python Worksheets<a>¶</a></h1><p>Write <span>Snowpark</span>code in Python worksheets to process data using Snowpark Python in Snowsight.
By writing code in Python worksheets, you can perform your development and testing in Snowflake without needing to install dependent libraries.</p><p>To develop with Python worksheets, do the following:</p><ol><p><span>Prepare roles and packages in Snowflake</span>.</p><p><span>Set up your worksheet for development</span>.</p><p><span>Write Snowpark code in your Python worksheet</span>.</p><p><span>Run your Python worksheet</span>.</p></ol><p>For example, you might write code in a Python worksheet that extracts data from stages or database objects in Snowflake, transforms the
data, and stores the transformed data in Snowflake. You could then
<span>deploy that code as a stored procedure</span>and build a data pipeline,
all without leaving Snowflake.</p><section><h2>About Python Worksheets<a>¶</a></h2><p>Python worksheets let you use Snowpark Python in Snowsight to perform data manipulations and transformations. You can use
<a>third-party packages listed in the Snowflake Anaconda channel</a>or import your own Python files
from stages to use in scripts.</p><p>After running a Python worksheet, review the results and output returned by your script. The results display as a string, variant, or a
table, depending on your code. See <span>Running Python Worksheets</span>.</p><div><p>Note</p><p>Because Python worksheets run inside Snowflake rather than in your local development environment, you cannot use <span>session.add_import</span>to add a file that your Python code depends on, or <span>session.add_packages</span>or <span>session.add_requirements</span>to add packages that you need
to use in your Python code. Instead, you add those files to a stage and reference them in your code.

If you’ve previously signed in to Snowsight, you might see an account name that you can select.</p><p>Sign in using your Snowflake account credentials.</p></ol></section><section><h2>Step 2. Open the Python worksheet<a>¶</a></h2><p>You can use Python worksheets to write and run Python code. Your trial account has access
to a pre-loaded Python worksheet for this tutorial. The worksheet has the Python code that
you will run to create a database, load data into it, and query the data. For more information
about Python worksheets, see <span>Writing Snowpark Code in Python Worksheets</span>.</p><p>To open the pre-loaded tutorial Python worksheet:</p><ol><p>Select <span>Projects</span>» <span>Worksheets</span>to open the list of worksheets.</p><li><p>Open <span>[Tutorial] Using Python to load and query sample data</span>.</p><p>Your worksheet looks similar to the following image.</p></li></ol><p>This pre-loaded Python worksheet automatically uses the ACCOUNTADMIN system role so that
you can view and manage objects in your account. For more information, see
<span>Using the ACCOUNTADMIN Role</span>.</p><p>The worksheet also uses the COMPUTE_WH virtual warehouse. A warehouse provides
the required resources to create and manage objects and run SQL commands. These
resources include CPU, memory, and temporary storage. For more information, see
<span>Virtual warehouses</span>.</p></section><section><h2>Step 3. Learn how to use Python worksheets<a>¶</a></h2><p>Python worksheets let you use <span>Snowpark Python</span>in Snowsight to run SQL statements. This step in this tutorial describes the code in each step
in the Python worksheet. When you use a Python worksheet, you cannot run individual blocks of
code separately. You must run the whole worksheet.
