This command returns the following output:
User SNOWMAN successfully created.
If you were creating a real user in a real Snowflake account, you would now send the
following information in a secure manner to the person who would need to access
this new account:
Snowflake Account URL: the Snowflake account link where the user will log in.
You can find this link at the top of your browser
(for example:
https://app.snowflake.com/myorg/myaccount/
,
where
myorg
is the Snowflake organization ID, and
myaccount
is the account ID).
LOGIN_NAME, as specified in the CREATE USER command.
PASSWORD, as specified in the CREATE USER command.
Step 5. Grant a system role and warehouse access to the user
¶
Now that you have created a user, you can use the SECURITYADMIN role to grant the
SYSADMIN role to the user, as well as grant USAGE on the COMPUTE_WH warehouse.
Granting a role to another role creates a parent-child relationship between the roles
(also referred to as a role hierarchy). Granting a role to a user enables the user to perform
all operations allowed by the role (through the access privileges granted to the role).
The SYSADMIN role has privileges to create warehouses, databases, and database objects
in an account and grant those privileges to other roles. Only grant this role to users who should
have these privileges. For information about other system-defined roles, see
see
Overview of Access Control
.
To grant the user access to a role and a warehouse, do the following:
In the open worksheet, place your cursor in the
USE ROLE
line,
then select
Run
.
USE
ROLE
SECURITYADMIN
;
Copy
Place your cursor in the
GRANT ROLE
line, enter the name of the user you created,
then select
Run
.

Step 6. Explore the users and roles in your account
¶
Now you can explore all the users and roles in your account by using the ACCOUNTADMIN role.
To explore users and roles, do the following:
In the open worksheet, place your cursor in the
USE ROLE
line,
then select
Run
.
USE
ROLE
ACCOUNTADMIN
;
Copy
Place your cursor in the
SHOW USERS
line, then select
Run
.
SHOW USERS
;
Copy
Your output looks similar to the following image.
Place your cursor in the
SHOW ROLES
line, then select
Run
.
SHOW ROLES
;
Copy
Your output looks similar to the following image.
Step 7. Drop the user and review key points
¶
Congratulations! You have successfully completed this tutorial for trial accounts.
Take a few minutes to review the key points that were covered.
Learn more by reviewing other topics in the Snowflake Documentation.
Drop the user
¶
Assuming that it is no longer needed, you can now drop the user you created.
In the open worksheet, place your cursor in the
DROP USER
line,
enter the name of the user you created, then select
Run
.
DROP
USER

;
Copy
Review key points
¶
In summary, you used a pre-loaded worksheet in Snowsight to complete the following steps:
Set the role to use.
Create a new user.
Grant the user role privileges and access to a warehouse.
Explore the users and roles in the account.
Drop the user you created.
Here are some key points to remember about users and roles:
You need the required permissions to create and manage objects in your account. In this tutorial,
you used the USERADMIN, SECURITYADMIN, SYSADMIN, and ACCOUNTADMIN system roles for different purposes.
The ACCOUNTADMIN role is not normally used to create objects. Instead, we recommend creating a
hierarchy of roles aligned with business functions in your organization. For more information, see
Using the ACCOUNTADMIN Role
.

Step 2. Open the [Template] worksheet
¶
You can use worksheets to write and run SQL commands on your database.
Your trial account has access to a pre-loaded template worksheet for this tutorial.
The worksheet contains the SQL commands that you will run to set the role context,
create a user, and grant role privileges. Because it is a template worksheet, you
will be invited to enter your own values for certain SQL parameters.
For more information about worksheets, see
Getting started with worksheets
.
To open the worksheet:
Select
Projects
»
Worksheets
to open the list of worksheets.
Open
[Template] Adding a user and granting roles
.
Your browser looks similar to the following image.
Step 3. Set the role to use
¶
The role you use determines the privileges you have. In this tutorial, use the
USERADMIN system role so that you can create and manage users and roles in your
account. For more information, see
Overview of Access Control
.
To set the role to use, do the following:
In the open worksheet, place your cursor in the
USE ROLE
line.
USE
ROLE
USERADMIN
;
Copy
In the upper-right corner of the worksheet, select
Run
.
Note
In this tutorial, run SQL statements one at a time. Do not select
Run All
.
Step 4. Create a user
¶
A Snowflake user has login credentials. When a user is granted a role, the user can
perform all the operations that the role allows, via the privileges that were
granted to the role. For more information, see
User management
.
In this step of the tutorial, you create a user with a name, a password, and some
other properties.
In the open worksheet, place your cursor in the
CREATE USER
line,
insert a username and other parameter values of your choice (an example is shown below), and
select
Run
.
For MUST_CHANGE_PASSWORD, set the value to
true
, which ensures that a password
reset is requested on first login. For DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE, use
COMPUTE_WH
.

Introduction
¶
This tutorial shows you how to create a user and grant a role to it by using SQL commands.
You use a template worksheet in Snowsight to follow and complete these tasks.
Note
Snowflake bills a minimal amount for the on-disk storage used for the sample data in
this tutorial. The tutorial provides steps to drop the database and minimize storage
cost.
Snowflake requires a
virtual warehouse
to load the
data and execute queries. A running virtual warehouse consumes Snowflake credits.
In this tutorial, you will be using a
30-day trial account
,
which provides free credits, so you won’t incur any costs.
What you will learn
¶
In this tutorial you will learn how to:
Use a role that has the privileges to create and use the Snowflake objects required by this tutorial.
Create a user.
Grant a role to the user and grant access to a warehouse.
Explore the users and roles in your account.
Drop the user you created.
Prerequisites
¶
This tutorial assumes the following:
You have a
supported browser
.
You have a trial account. If you do not have a trial account yet, you can sign up
for a
free trial
. You can choose any
Snowflake Cloud Region
.
Your user is the account administrator and is granted the ACCOUNTADMIN system role. For more information, see
Using the ACCOUNTADMIN Role
.
Note
This tutorial is only available to users with a trial account. The sample worksheet is not available
for other types of accounts.
Step 1. Sign in using Snowsight
¶
To access Snowsight over the public Internet, do the following:
In a supported web browser, navigate to
https://app.snowflake.com
.
Provide your
account identifier
or account URL.
If you’ve previously signed in to Snowsight, you might see an account name that you can select.
Sign in using your Snowflake account credentials.
