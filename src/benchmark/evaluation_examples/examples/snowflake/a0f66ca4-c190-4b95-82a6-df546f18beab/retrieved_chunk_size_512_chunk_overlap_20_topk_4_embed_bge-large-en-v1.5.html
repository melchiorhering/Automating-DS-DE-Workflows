Set the role to use<a>¶</a></h2><p>The role you use determines the privileges you have. In this tutorial, use the
USERADMIN system role so that you can create and manage users and roles in your
account. For more information, see <span>Overview of Access Control</span>.</p><p>To set the role to use, do the following:</p><ol><li><p>In the open worksheet, place your cursor in the <span>USE ROLE</span>line.</p><div><pre><span>USE</span><span>ROLE</span><span>USERADMIN</span><span>;</span></pre><span>Copy</span></div></li><li><p>In the upper-right corner of the worksheet, select <span>Run</span>.</p><div><p>Note</p><p>In this tutorial, run SQL statements one at a time. Do not select <span>Run All</span>.</p></div></li></ol></section><section><h2>Step 4. Create a user<a>¶</a></h2><p>A Snowflake user has login credentials. When a user is granted a role, the user can
perform all the operations that the role allows, via the privileges that were
granted to the role. For more information, see <span>User management</span>.</p><p>In this step of the tutorial, you create a user with a name, a password, and some
other properties.</p><p>In the open worksheet, place your cursor in the <span>CREATE USER</span>line,
insert a username and other parameter values of your choice (an example is shown below), and
select <span>Run</span>.</p><p>For MUST_CHANGE_PASSWORD, set the value to <span>true</span>, which ensures that a password
reset is requested on first login.
