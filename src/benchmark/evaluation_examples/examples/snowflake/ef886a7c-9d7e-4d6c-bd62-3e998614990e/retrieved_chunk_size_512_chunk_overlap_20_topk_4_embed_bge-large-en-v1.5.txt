Documentation Title:
Visualizing worksheet data | Snowflake Documentation

Documentation Content:
Each query supports one type of chart at a time.
Hover over the chart to view details about each data point. For example, you can view your results as a line chart:
You can modify the type of chart used to display your query results.
Select the chart type to choose a different type, for example,
Bar
.
You can manage the columns in your chart with the
Data
section:
Select a column to modify the column attributes:
Add or remove columns.
Choose a different column in the query results to use in the chart.
Modify how column data is represented in the chart. For example, change the bucketing for a time column from day to minutes.
You can modify the column attributes to configure how data in that column is rendered in the chart. See
Aggregate and bucket data
for more details about managing aggregate data.
Style your chart in the
Appearance
section. The available settings depend on the type of chart. For example, for a heatgrid
chart:
The exact content of your charts depends on your query results. To generate the examples in this topic, use the following query based
on the Snowflake sample data:
SELECT
COUNT
(
O_ORDERDATE
)
as
orders
,
O_ORDERDATE
as
date
FROM
SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA
.
TPCH_SF1
.
ORDERS
WHERE
O_ORDERDATE
=
:daterange
GROUP
BY
:datebucket
(
O_ORDERDATE
),
O_ORDERDATE
ORDER
BY
O_ORDERDATE
LIMIT
10
;

Charts and new query results
¶
Your chart updates automatically as long as the columns used by the chart are available in the query results. If a column name changes, you
must update the chart to use the new column name. Charts indicate any columns that cannot be found.
Aggregate and bucket data
¶
Charts simplify grouping numbers, dates, and timestamps of more or less continuous values into various
buckets
. For example, suppose your
query retrieves per-day data over a period of time. Without modifying your query, you can easily select a different bucket of time (e.g.
weekly or monthly data) in the inspector panel to change the time dimension of the results displayed in the chart.

Getting started with worksheets | Snowflake Documentation

Documentation Content:
Select
+
and select
SQL Worksheet
or
Python Worksheet
to create a worksheet.
The worksheet opens in the same window with the date and time of creation as the default title.
You can then start writing in your worksheet. For a SQL worksheet,

.
For a Python worksheet,

.
Create worksheets from a SQL file
¶
To create a SQL worksheet from an existing SQL file, do the following:
Sign in to Snowsight.
Select
Projects
»
Worksheets
to open the list of worksheets.
Select the
…
more menu »
Create Worksheet from SQL File
.
Browse to the SQL file to upload.
A new worksheet opens with a title that matches the file name.
You can also add a SQL file to an existing SQL worksheet. Refer to
Append a SQL script to an existing worksheet
.
Opening worksheets in tabs
¶
You can use tabs to refer to multiple active worksheets and explore the databases and schemas in Snowflake while writing SQL
statements or Python code in Snowsight. Your scroll position is preserved in each tab, making comparisons across worksheets easier
to perform. Worksheet tabs are preserved across sessions, so you can pick up your work where you left off.
To open your Snowsight worksheets in tabs, do the following:
Sign in to Snowsight.
Select
Projects
»
Worksheets
.
Select an existing worksheet, or select
+ Worksheet
to open a new worksheet. A worksheet opens in a tab.
Select a role to run the worksheet as, and select a warehouse to allocate the compute resources for your query.
In the
Worksheets
menu, select an existing worksheet or select
+
to open a new worksheet tab. By default, the new worksheet
uses your default role and warehouse.
(Optional) Make changes to the role or warehouse used to run the new worksheet.
After you open a worksheet, you can
update the contents
,
run SQL statements
or
write Python code
, and manage the worksheet.

Visualize query results with charts and dashboards
¶
When you run a query in Snowsight, you can choose to view your results as a chart. You can also create a collection of charts
as a
Dashboard
, allowing you to review your data more easily. Dashboards provide flexible collections of charts arranged as tiles.
Dashboard charts start with SQL to generate results and associated charts. You can share these charts with others, modify the charts,
and display them as dashboard tiles.
To learn more about charts, see
Visualizing worksheet data
. To learn more about dashboards,
see
Visualizing data with dashboards
Explore and manage your database objects
¶
You can explore and manage your database objects in Snowsight as follows:
Explore databases and objects, including tables, functions, views, and more using the database object explorer.
Create objects like databases, tables, file formats, and more.
Search within the object explorer to browse database objects across your account.
Preview the contents of database objects like tables, and view the files uploaded to a stage.
Load files to an existing table, or create a table from a file so that you can start working with data in Snowflake faster.
To learn more, see:

Share and publish data products
¶
Collaborate with users in other Snowflake accounts by sharing data and application packages with them, or publishing those data products
on the Snowflake Marketplace. When you share or publish data products with a listing, you can use auto-fulfillment to easily provide your data
products in other Snowflake regions.
As a consumer of data, you can access datasets and application packages shared with your account or published on the Snowflake Marketplace,
helping you derive real time data insights without needing to set up a data pipeline or write any code.

command (or within the Worksheet in the web interface.)
Using the Tutorial SQL Scripts
¶
Snowflake provides a set of tutorials, which are annotated SQL statements that query the sample data sets to answer a set of practical business questions.
To access the tutorials from Classic Console:
In the
Worksheets
page, click on the down-arrow next to the worksheet tabs and select
Open Tutorials
:
The
Open Worksheet
dialog displays the list of available tutorials. In the dialog, select a tutorial and click on the
Open
button:
A new worksheet is created containing the contents of the tutorial:
You can then execute the queries in the tutorial as you would in any worksheet. You can also alter the tutorial in the worksheet and save it as a custom worksheet.
