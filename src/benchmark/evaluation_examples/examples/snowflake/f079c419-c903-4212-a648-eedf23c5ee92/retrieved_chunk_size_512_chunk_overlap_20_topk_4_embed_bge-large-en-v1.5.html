Documentation Title:
Search Snowflake objects and resources with Universal Search | Snowflake Documentation

Documentation Content:
For example, you can use keyword search
terms, like “opportunities” or “sales opportunities”, or use more conversational natural language search terms, like
“sales opportunities that are likely to close” or “which opportunities came from partner referrals”.</p><p>For example, if you search for “zip codes”, Universal Search returns results such as listings on the Snowflake Marketplace that mention postal
code data and a table with the column name <span>postal_code</span>.</p><p>To make it easier to find the right data for your project, object metadata such as names, comments, and tags for objects and columns
are searched. Universal Search searches only the object metadata, not the contents of your database objects.</p><section><h2>Search for objects in Snowsight<a>¶</a></h2><p>When you search for objects in Snowsight, you only see results that your currently active role has privileges to view.</p><p>To search, complete the following steps:</p><ol><p>Sign in to Snowsight.</p><p>In the navigation menu, select <span>Search</span>.</p><li><p>Enter search terms, and press Return to search.</p><p>Results are displayed in categories. If a category isn’t displayed, there are no results for that category or your currently active role
doesn’t have access to those results.</p></li><p>Select a search result to view details. For a database object, you can select <span>Open in Worksheets</span>to query the object in a worksheet.</p></ol><p>To get or purchase listings offered on the Snowflake Marketplace that appear in the results, you must have agreed to the Snowflake Provider
and Consumer Terms.
