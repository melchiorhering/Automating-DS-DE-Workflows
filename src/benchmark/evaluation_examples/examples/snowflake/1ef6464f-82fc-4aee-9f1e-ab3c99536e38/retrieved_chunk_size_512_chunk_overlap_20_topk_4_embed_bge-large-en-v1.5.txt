Filter query results in worksheets and dashboards
Filter query results in dashboards and worksheets
¶
You can filter your query results in dashboards and SQL worksheets using system filters, available to all roles in Snowflake,
or with custom filters created by administrators.
Create custom filters
¶
Custom filters let you change the results of a query without directly editing the query.
Filters are implemented as special keywords that resolve as a subquery or list of values, which are then used in the execution of a query.
As a result, there are some limitations when using a filter in a SQL query. See
Specify a filter in a SQL query
.
Note
Anyone in your account can view and use a custom filter after it is created. A custom filter has an associated role,
but that role does not limit filter visibility.

Filters
dialog.
Write a query to populate a filter
¶
To populate a list of filter options from a query, your query must follow certain guidelines:
Must return the columns
name
and
value
.
Can return the optional column
description
.
Can return other columns, but those do not appear in the drop-down filter list.
A filter can only run one query at a time. You cannot run multiple queries to generate the list of filter options, for example by running
one query to return the
name
column and a second query to return the
value
column.
Note
The query used to populate a list of filter options is run as the user that created (or last modified) the filter.
Because anyone in your account can view and use a custom filter after it is created, make sure that the list of
filter options produced by your query do not contain protected or sensitive data.
After you write your filter query and add it in the
New filter
dialog, do the following to finish setting up your query filter:
Select
Done
to save your filter query and return to the
Add Filter
dialog.
Optionally change the default refresh option from
Refresh hourly
to
Never refresh
or
Refresh daily
. For details
and considerations for filter refresh options, see
Manage refresh frequency for a custom filter
.
Return to the steps for creating a custom filter to finish creating your filter. See
Create a custom filter
.
Review and manage custom filters in an account
¶
To review custom filters in your account, open a worksheet or dashboard and then select
.
To make changes to any filters, such as changing the refresh frequency for the query used to populate a custom filter list,
you must have the ACCOUNTADMIN role or a role with
permissions to manage filters
.
See
Manage refresh frequency for a custom filter
.
Manage ownership of custom filters
¶
Each custom filter has an associated role. Anyone with that role can edit or delete the filter.
Users with the ACCOUNTADMIN role can view and edit every filter in the account.
If the role associated with a filter is dropped, the role dropping the filter role does
not
inherit ownership of the custom filter.

For
Warehouse

Select
Save
.
Create a custom filter

You must use Snowsight to create a filter, and you must use a role with permissions to create custom filters.
To create a custom filter, do the following:
Sign in to Snowsight.
Select
Projects
»
Worksheets
to open the list of worksheets and open a worksheet,
or select
Projects
»
Dashboards
to open the list of dashboards and open a dashboard.

, without spaces.
For example:
:page_path
.
For
Description
, enter a description of the filter.
For
Role
