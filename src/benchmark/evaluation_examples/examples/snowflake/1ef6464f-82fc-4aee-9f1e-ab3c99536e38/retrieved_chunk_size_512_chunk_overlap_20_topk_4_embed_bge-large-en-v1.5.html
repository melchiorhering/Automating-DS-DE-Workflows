or with custom filters created by administrators.</p><section><h2>Create custom filters<a>¶</a></h2><p>Custom filters let you change the results of a query without directly editing the query.</p><p>Filters are implemented as special keywords that resolve as a subquery or list of values, which are then used in the execution of a query.
As a result, there are some limitations when using a filter in a SQL query. See <span>Specify a filter in a SQL query</span>.</p><div><p>Note</p><p>Anyone in your account can view and use a custom filter after it is created. A custom filter has an associated role,
but that role does not limit filter visibility.</p></div><section><h3>Grant permission to create custom filters<a>¶</a></h3><p>To let a user create custom filters, a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role must grant the relevant permissions to a role granted to that user.
