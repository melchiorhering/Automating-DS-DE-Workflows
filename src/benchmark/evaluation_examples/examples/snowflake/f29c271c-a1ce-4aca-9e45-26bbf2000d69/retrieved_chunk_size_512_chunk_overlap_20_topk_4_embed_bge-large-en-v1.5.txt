Snowsight loads the file and creates a new table for the file.
Loading data using Classic Console
¶
The Classic Console provides a wizard for loading limited amounts of data into a table from a small set of files.
The wizard performs the same PUT and COPY operations that you would using SQL, but combines the two phases (staging files and loading data)
into a single operation and deleting all staged files after the load completes.
You can load data from files on your local machine or files already staged in an existing cloud storage location on Snowflake, Amazon S3,
Google Cloud Storage, or Microsoft Azure.
Prerequisites for loading data
¶
Before you start loading data using Classic Console, do the following:
Identify the location your data files. You can load data from one of the following:
Your local machine.
An internal or external stage.
