Opening worksheets in tabs
¶
You can use tabs to refer to multiple active worksheets and explore the databases and schemas in Snowflake while writing SQL
statements or Python code in Snowsight. Your scroll position is preserved in each tab, making comparisons across worksheets easier
to perform. Worksheet tabs are preserved across sessions, so you can pick up your work where you left off.
To open your Snowsight worksheets in tabs, do the following:
Sign in to Snowsight.
Select
Projects

Documentation Title:
Using Worksheets for Queries / DML / DDL | Snowflake Documentation

Documentation Content:
Opening multiple, concurrent worksheets, each with its own separate session, allowing you to run queries in different worksheets with different contexts without any degradation in UI performance.
Saving a worksheet for later use.
Opening a worksheet from your library of saved worksheets.
Note
Saved worksheets are not accessible outside of the Classic Console.
Saved worksheets cannot currently be shared with other users.
Loading SQL script files from your workstation or network into a worksheet. After you’ve loaded a script file, you can optionally edit and save it to your library of saved worksheets.
Logging out without losing your work. Snowflake retains the static contents of each worksheet, so you can log in again later and resume working where you left off. Snowflake displays the worksheets
that were open when you logged out.
Note that resized/collapsed panes, width changes to the result/data preview columns, and even the cursor position in the SQL editor, are persisted:
When switching between open worksheets.
When closing and reopening the same worksheet.
Between user sessions.
Specifying a different role for each worksheet and switching roles without losing your work. You can execute specific statements in a worksheet, then switch roles before continuing your work
in the same worksheet.
Note
Your current interface role determines the default role for worksheets that you open, but the worksheets are not tied to the interface role. Each worksheet has its own role that can be set
independently.
Logging into Snowflake in another browser or tab. Any worksheet changes you made in one Snowflake instance persist to the other instance after a minute or two. You can continue working in the
other browser (or tab) without re-entering your work.
Refreshing your browser, if necessary. If you’re in the middle of running queries, they will resume running when the refresh is completed. Note that if you log out of Snowflake, any active
queries stop running.
You can also perform other tasks on this page, including:
Resizing the current warehouse to dynamically increase or decrease the compute resources utilized for executing your queries and other DML statements.
Exporting the result for a selected query/statement (if the result is still available). For more information, see
Exporting Query Results
.
Saving and Managing Worksheets
¶
Snowflake automatically saves worksheets as you type and persists the current state of a worksheet between user sessions.



Documentation Source:
docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight-query.txt

Documentation Title:
Querying data using worksheets | Snowflake Documentation

Documentation Content:
Snowflake tracks table aliases and suggests them as autocomplete options. For example, if you execute a query using
posts
as
p
or
posts
p
as an alias, the next time you type
p
, the autocomplete feature suggests the alias as an option.
Use Snowflake Copilot to write queries
¶
Snowflake Copilot is an LLM-powered assistant that simplifies data analysis. You can use natural language requests to explore a new dataset,
generate queries or refine existing queries.
See
Using Snowflake Copilot
to learn more about Snowflake Copilot and for example prompts to get you started.
Append a SQL script to an existing worksheet
¶
If you have a SQL script in a file, you can append it to an existing worksheet by doing the following:
Sign in to Snowsight.
Select
Projects
»
Worksheets
to open the list of worksheets.
Open a worksheet.
Hover over the tab for the worksheet and select
, then choose
Import SQL from File
.
Browse to the SQL file on your computer.
The file contents are appended to your worksheet.
Refer to database object names in worksheets
¶
While you write queries in your worksheet, refer to the database objects relevant to the queries in the
Databases
explorer. You can
drill down to specific database objects, or use search to locate a database, schema, or object that you have access to.
Using the
Databases
explorer, you can pin databases and database objects for quick reference. When you hover over a database object,
select the
Pin
icon to pin them. Pinned objects appear at the top of the
Databases
explorer in the
Pinned
section.
You might need to expand the section to view of all your pinned objects.
After you locate a database object, you can place the name of the object in the worksheet that you’re editing:
Sign in to Snowsight.
Select
Projects
»
Worksheets

Open a worksheet.
Locate the database object in the
Databases
explorer.
Hover over the object name and select
