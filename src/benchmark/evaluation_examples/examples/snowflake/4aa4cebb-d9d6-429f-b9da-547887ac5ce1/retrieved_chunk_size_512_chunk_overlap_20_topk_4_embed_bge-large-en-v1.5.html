The wizard performs the same PUT and COPY operations that you would using SQL, but combines the two phases (staging files and loading data)
into a single operation and deleting all staged files after the load completes.</p><p>You can load data from files on your local machine or files already staged in an existing cloud storage location on Snowflake, Amazon S3,
Google Cloud Storage, or Microsoft Azure.</p><section><h3>Prerequisites for loading data<a>¶</a></h3><p>Before you start loading data using Classic Console, do the following:</p><ul><li><p>Identify the location your data files.

Tutorial: Bulk loading from a local file system using COPY | Snowflake Documentation

Documentation Content:
The statement also sets <code><span>AUTO_RESUME</span><span>=</span><span>true</span></code>, which starts the warehouse automatically
when you execute SQL statements that require compute resources.</p></section></section><section><h2>Step 1. Create file format objects<a>¶</a></h2><p>When you load data from a file into a table, you must describe the format of the file
and specify how the data in the file should be interpreted and processed. For example,
if you are loading pipe-delimited data from a CSV file, you must specify that the file
uses the CSV format with pipe symbols as delimiters.</p><p>When you execute the <span>COPY INTO &lt;table&gt;</span>command, you specify this format information. You can
either specify this information as options in the command (e.g.
<code><span>TYPE</span><span>=</span><span>CSV</span></code>, <code><span>FIELD_DELIMITER</span><span>=</span><span>'|'</span></code>, etc.) or you can specify a
file format object that contains this format information.
