This view is useful for seeing DAG runs over time and troubleshooting previously failed task instances.</p><p>Click on a green square to display additional information about the related task instance on the right side of the Airflow UI. The task instance view includes tabs with additional information for the task instance, such as its logs and historic runs. This is one of many available views that show details about your DAG.</p><p>To access information about mapped task instances of a dynamically mapped task, click the green square of the mapping task instance and then click on <strong>[] Mapped task</strong>to view a list of all dynamically mapped task instances. Click on any entry in the list to access information about the dynamically mapped task instance.</p></li><p>In the <strong>Grid</strong>view, click the <strong>Graph</strong>tab. This view shows task dependencies and relationships and can help you troubleshoot dependency issues. When you select a DAG run in the Grid view, the Graph tab shows the last state of each task instance in this DAG run.</p><p>In the <strong>Grid</strong>view, click the <strong>Code</strong>tab to display your DAG source code.

Here you can find information like total historic runs of a DAG, the data interval start of a DAG run, and the duration of a task instance.</p><p>To access the details of a specific DAG run or task instance, you need first need to select it in the DAG grid as shown in the following gif:</p><p>When you select a task instance in the DAG grid, three additional options appear underneath the tabs:</p><ul><li><strong>More Details:</strong>Shows all attributes of a task, including variables and templates.</li><li><strong>Rendered Template:</strong>Shows the task's metadata after it has been templated.</li><li><strong>List Instances, all runs:</strong>Shows a historical view of task instances and statuses for that particular task.</li></ul><h3>Graph<a>​</a></h3><p>The <strong>Graph</strong>tab shows a  graph visualization of the tasks and dependencies in your DAG, including <a>Airflow datasets</a>a DAG is scheduled on or updates. If you select a task or task group instance in a DAG grid column, the graph highlights and zooms to the selected task. You can also navigate complex DAGs using <strong>Filter Tasks</strong>option and the minimap. This view is useful to explore the DAG structure and task dependencies.</p><div><div>note</div><p>Earlier Airflow versions had a different <strong>Graph</strong>view that was not integrated into the DAG view. See the <a>Airflow documentation of your version</a>for more information.</p></div><h3>Code<a>​</a></h3><p>Under the <strong>Code</strong>tab you can access the code that generates the DAG you are viewing. While your code should live in source control, the <strong>Code</strong>tab provides a quick insight into what is going on in the DAG. DAG code can't be edited in the UI.</p><p>This tab shows code only from the file that generated the DAG.
