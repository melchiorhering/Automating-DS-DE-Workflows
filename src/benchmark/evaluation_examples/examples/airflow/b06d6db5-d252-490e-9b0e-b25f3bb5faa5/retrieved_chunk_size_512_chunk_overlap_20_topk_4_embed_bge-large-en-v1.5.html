A DAG with a <code>start_date</code>in the future will result in a successful DAG run with no task runs. Do not use <code>datetime.now()</code>as a <code>start_date</code>.</p><p>Test the DAG using <code>astro dev dags test &lt;dag_id&gt;</code>. With the Airflow CLI, run <code>airflow dags test &lt;dag_id&gt;</code>.</p><p>If no DAGs are running, check the state of your scheduler
using <code>astro dev logs -s</code>.</p><p>If too many runs of your DAG are being scheduled after you unpause it, you most likely need to set <code>catchup=False</code>in your DAG's parameters.</p></ul><p>If your DAG is running, but not on the schedule you expected, review the <a>DAG Schedule DAGs in Airflow</a>guide. If you are using a custom timetable, ensure that the data interval for your DAG run does not precede the DAG start date.</p><h2>Common task issues<a>​</a></h2><p>This section covers common issues related to individual tasks you might encounter. If your entire DAG is not working, see the <a>DAGs are not running correctly</a>section above.</p><h3>Tasks are not running correctly<a>​</a></h3><p>It is possible for a DAG to start but its tasks to be stuck in various states or to not run in the desired order. If your tasks are not running as intended, try the following debugging methods:</p><ul><li>Double check that your DAG's <code>start_date</code>is in the past. A future <code>start_date</code>will result in a successful DAG run even though no tasks ran.</li><li>If your tasks stay in a <code>scheduled</code>or <code>queued</code>state, ensure your scheduler is running properly.

Documentation Content:
If the DAG appears in the list but not in the UI, try restarting the Airflow webserver.</p><p>Try restarting the Airflow scheduler with <code>astro dev restart</code>.</p><p>If you see an error in the Airflow UI indicating that the scheduler is not running, check the scheduler logs to see if an error in a DAG file is causing the scheduler to crash. If you are using the Astro CLI, run <code>astro dev logs -s</code>and then try restarting.</p></ul><p>At the code level, ensure that each DAG:</p><ul><li>Has a unique <code>dag_id</code>.</li><li>Contains either the word <code>airflow</code>or the word <code>dag</code>. The scheduler only parses files fulfilling this condition.</li><li>Is called when defined with the <code>@dag</code>decorator. See also <a>Introduction to Airflow decorators</a>.</li></ul><h3>Import errors due to dependency conflicts<a>​</a></h3><p>A frequent cause of DAG import errors is not having the necessary packages installed in your Airflow environment. You might be missing <a>provider packages</a>that are required for using specific operators or hooks, or you might be missing Python packages used in Airflow tasks.</p><p>In an Astro project, you can install OS-level packages by adding them to your <code>packages.txt</code>file. You can install Python-level packages, such as provider packages, by adding them to your <code>requirements.txt</code>file. If you need to install packages using a specific package manager, consider doing so by adding a bash command to your Dockerfile.</p><p>To prevent compatibility issues when new packages are released, Astronomer recommends pinning a package version to your project. For example, adding <code>astronomer-providers[all]==1.14.0</code>to your <code>requirements.txt</code>file ensures that no future releases of <code>astronomer-providers</code>causes compatibility issues.

Documentation Content:
If no version is pinned, Airflow will always use the latest available version.</p><p>If you are using the Astro CLI, packages are installed in the scheduler Docker container. You can confirm that a package is installed correctly by running:</p><span><span>astro dev </span><span>bash</span><span>--scheduler</span><span>"pip freeze | grep &lt;package-name&gt;"</span></span><p>If you have conflicting package versions or need to run multiple Python versions, you can run tasks in different environments using a few different operators:</p><ul><li><a>KubernetesPodOperator</a>: Runs a task in a separate Kubernetes Pod.</li><li><a>ExternalPythonOperator</a>: Runs a task in a predefined virtual environment.</li><li><a>PythonVirtualEnvOperator</a>: Runs a task in a temporary virtual environment.</li></ul><p>If many Airflow tasks share a set of alternate package and version requirements a common pattern is to run them in two or more separate Airflow deployments.</p><h3>DAGs are not running correctly<a>​</a></h3><p>If your DAGs are either not running or running differently than you intended, consider checking the following common causes:</p><ul><li><p>DAGs need to be unpaused in order to run on their schedule. You can unpause a DAG by clicking the toggle on the left side of the Airflow UI or by using the <a>Airflow CLI</a>.</p><p>If you want all DAGs unpaused by default, you can set <code>dags_are_paused_at_creation=False</code>in your Airflow config. If you do this, remember to set <code>catchup=False</code>in your DAGs to prevent automatic backfilling of DAG runs. Paused DAGs are unpaused automatically when you manually trigger them.</p></li><p>Double check that each DAG has a unique <code>dag_id</code>. If two DAGs with the same id are present in one Airflow instance the scheduler will pick one at random every 30 seconds to display.</p><p>Make sure your DAG has a <code>start_date</code>in the past.

Documentation Content:
If the task fails twice in a row or is not scheduled within a 10-minute interval, Astronomer support receives an alert and will work with you to troubleshoot.</p><p>Because this DAG is essential to Astro's managed service, your organization will not be charged for its task runs. For the same reasons, this DAG can't be modified or disabled via the Airflow UI. To modify how frequently this DAG runs, you can specify an alternate schedule as a cron expression by setting <code>AIRFLOW_MONITORING_DAG_SCHEDULE_INTERVAL</code>as an environment variable.</p><h2>Astro Runtime 4.0.6<a>​</a></h2><ul><li>Release date: December 2, 2021</li><li>Airflow version: 2.2.2</li></ul><h3>Additional improvements<a>​</a></h3><li>User-supplied <code>airflow.cfg</code>files are no longer valid in Astro projects.
